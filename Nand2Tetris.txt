Week 1: Boolean Logic
-----
Commutative Law:
---
x AND y = y AND x
x OR y = y OR x

Associative Law:
---
x AND (y AND z) = (x AND y) AND z
x OR (y OR z) = (x OR y) OR z

Distributive Law:
---
x AND (y OR z) = (x AND y) OR (x AND z)
x OR (y AND z) = (x OR y) AND (x OR z)


De Morgan Law:
---
NOT (x OR y) = NOT (x) AND NOT (y)
NOT (x AND y) = NOT (x) OR NOT (y)

Idempotent Law:
---
w AND w = w
w OR w = w



Truth Table to Boolean Expression: How to?
---
- For every row resulting in 1, write a boolean expression for that row alone
  (ignore other rows). OR all these expressions.

Theorem 1:
Any boolean function can be represented using an expression containing AND, OR
and NOT.

Theorem 2:
A boolean function can be represented using AND and NOT gates only.

Theorem 3:
A boolean function can be represented using NAND gate alone.

x NAND y = NOT (x AND y)

- How can an AND be done using NAND?
    x AND y = NOT (x NAND y)

- How can a NOT be done using NAND?
    NOT (x) = x NAND x

Logic Gates
---

Truth Table of NAND gate:
    x   y   out
    0   0   1
    0   1   1
    1   0   1
    1   1   0

Functional Spec: if (x==1 and y==1) then out = 0
                 else out = 1


Other elementary gates: AND, OR and NOT


Composite Gates:
---
- Some of logic gates to form a more complex gate.


HDL:
---
- HDL is a functional/declarative language.
- Order of HDL statements is insignificant.
- Interface of logic gates:
    Not (a=, out=), And (a=, b=, out=), Or (a=, b=, out=)

- Common HDLs: VHDL, Verilog and many more.
-


Multiplexor:
-----
Three Inputs: a, b, sel
One Output: out

if (sel ==0) out = a
else out = b


Demultiplexor: Inverse of Multiplexor
---
Input: in, sel
Output: a, b

if (sel==0) {a,b} = {in,0}
else {a,b} = {0,in}



Project 1: 3 types of logic gates will be built.

    Elementary Logic Gates: Not, And, Or, Xor, Mux, DMux
    16-bit variants: Not16, And16, Or16, Mux16
    Multi-way variants: Or8Way, Mux4Way16, Mux8Way16, DMux4Way, DMux8Way
