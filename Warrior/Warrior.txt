@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@         UNDERWRITING CLASS       @@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

- Amar Nagireddy taught this class.

- Unit is about 200, in Cincinnati, OH
    - Two parts to analysis: Market Analysis, Actual Portfolio

Step 1: Market Analysis
===============
1) Get baseline crime rate at: www.spotcrime.com
    - Put your own home address and get baseline.
    - Put property address and get details.
    - No shootings. Small crime is OK.
    - Only after crime is low, move to next step.

Step 2: Portfolio Analysis
==================
REQUIRED:
    - Offering Memorandum (OM)
    - T12 (or P&L statement). For large properties, ask T3.
    - Rent Roll, usually Seller gives only most recent month.


NOTES:
- Always look for current insurance rates and tax rates in Offering Memorandum
  (OM). This should be in Proforma. Everything else is waste in Proforma.
- How many Starbucks are nearby? Usually, but not always, Starbucks does due
  diligence and the area is improving.
    - Starbucks does planning, talk to City, whats coming up in next 3-5 years.
    - Wholefoods, Trader Joe's

Lifetime Cashflow Through Multifamily 
Course & Coaching Program
=========================

Advanced Deal Structure
---
What are we splitting?
    - The Deal
    - The Sponsor (GP)
    - The Operating Company/Branded Entity


The Deal
--------
    - Preferred Return
    - Split of Cash Flow (also called Promote)
        - Profits
        - Principal (original Capital)

    - Deal Returns Example
        - 7% Pref and 70/30 Split
        - Investors (LP) have Class A shares
        - Operators (GP) have Class B shares
        - Suppose there is $1M in equity and $150,000 to distribute

        - Distribution:
            - $70,000 goes to pay preferred return for investors (LP), that is 7% pref.
            - Remaining $80,000 is split 70% to investors and 30% to sponsor.
                - Investors get $56,000
                - GP get $24,000
            - Investors reveiced total of 12.6%

    - The Sponsors Split
        - All Split Equally (rarely happens)
            - Less Flexible
            - Builds Long Term Brand
            - Possibly Slower Growth
        - All Split Uniquely (common)
            - More Flexible
            - Less Long Term Brand
            - Usually Faster Growth

Module #2
---------
  Building Good Relationship with Broker
  ---
    • One good broker can make you wealthy
    • Have a script to talk to, when calling them.
        • ALWAYS ALWAYS respond when they send you a deal. 
        • On LoopNet there are brokers who have lot of listings. Call them and
        establish relationship.
        • Keep writing to them every 3-4 weeks so that you are in their mind
        when they get a deal.

    • Brokers have Pocket Listings
        - Deals that are not public yet, not on LoopNet yet.
        - We must get them.

    * Third way to get Pocket Listings
        - Determine the area/market
        - Buy, or ideally, build your database - difficult, but worth it.
        - Find accurate owner info
        - Find local independent broker in the area.
        - "interview" the broker.
        - Provide the broker your pre-made property list.
        - Broker can approach all of the property owners on that list.
        - Repeat the process in other areas/market.

    * If a property is in an LLC, go to Secretary of State and get Owner info.


  Sourcing Deals
  ---
    * Craigslist
        - Hundreds of leads there.
        - Only 10-15 mins/day
        - High quantity of mom and pops.
        - Post ads on Craigslist for purchasing multi-family properties.
        - Call FSBO (For Sale By Owner)
    * Calling "For Rent" ads

    * Direct mailing

    * Auctions

        - No time for due diligence (must do before hand).
        - Must line up cash/finance ahead of time.
        - Join the websites, just to analyze deals.
            - You MUST develop expertise at evaluating deals and Auctions is
              great way to do that.

    * Wholesalers & Birddogs
        - Give them referral fees. States have some rules when to and when NOT

    Step 1: Adjust the Income
        - Calculate Gross Potential Rent
        - Use 10% vacancy

    Step 2: Adjust the Expenses
        - Use 50% of Income. If Proforma uses bigger number, use that.

    Step 3: Use advertised Cap Rate to come up with Fair Market Value


@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@   GLOSSARY     @@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@


Example Asset:
    Purchase Price: $10,000,000 ($10M)
    Down Payment (30%): $3,000,000 ($30M)
    GOI:
    NOI:
    Debt:



GOI = Gross Operating Income
    - All the income from property
    - Other Names:
        - Gross Potential Annual Income
        - Gross Potential Income

NOI = Net Operating Income
    NOI = GOI - Expense (but not Debt)

Cap Rate = Capitalization Rate
    - Indicator of the return.
    - A little bit abstract concept. Brokers, Buyers/Sellers and in general,
      the market, determines what is the Cap Rate in that area/location.
    - If you had purchased the asset in cash, did not take debt, then Cap Rate
      is your annual return on that cash.

                                NOI
            Cap Rate =      ------------

    - Where to get Cap Rate?
        - Brokers provide
        - Sales Comps (Co-Star etc)
        - Bank Appraisers (call and ask them)

Cash-on-Cash Return

Anual Rate of Return (ARR)

            (Total $ distributed over life cycle / Number of years) 
    ARR =   -------------------------------------------------------
            Total amount invested

    Example:

                (75,000 / 5)
        ARR =   ------------ = 15%
                 100,000

        - Total cash distributed over 5 years is $75,000


Difference between ARR and IRR
    - If partial, or full principal is paid back to investor mid-life cycle, no
      way to compute ARR mathematically, from that point onwards.
        - IRR has no issues with this event.
    - IRR takes Time Value of Money into account.
