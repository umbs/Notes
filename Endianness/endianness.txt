Consider two byte number: 0xabcd; left being smallest memory address and right
being highest. 

Big-Endian (aka Network Byte Order) is represented as: 0xabcd; 
Ex: Motorola 68k, Data transfer on networks use NBO,  

Little-Endian is represented as: 0xcdab 
Ex: Intel x86 

Host-Byte Order: Ordering on the host machine. If processor is x86, its
little-endian, if its Motorola's 68k, its big-endian. 
 
Mixed-Endian (or Middle-Endian): Ordering of bytes within 16-bit word may differ
from ordering of 16-bit words within 32-bit word. 
Ex: 

Bi-Endian: Architectures allowing switchable endianness in data segment, code
segment or both. 'Bi-Endian' refers how processor accesses data. Instruction
access (fetching instruction words) is usually fixed endian. Intel's Itanium CPU
allows bi-endian data and instruction access.   
Ex: ARM version 3 and above, PowerPC,
