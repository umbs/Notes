Vid 1: What it means to buy a company's stock
-----
+ Equity = (Assets - Liabilities) 
+ Theoretically, value of one share = Equity/Number of shares. 
+ If share price is greater than above theoretical value then people
expect the company to do well. If its lower, people expect it to do
badly?? 

+ Current Assets = Value that can be 'converted' to cash/money in next one
year. 
+ Current Liabilities = Money owed/debt to be payed in next one year. 

Vid 2: Primer on unemployment rate
-----
+ Total US population ~300M 
+ Total US population > 16 or more years of age (employable age) ~237M 
+ Actual Labor Force = Working population 
                             + 
                       Actively looking for work population
                     ~155M 
+ Unemployed People = Unemployed + Actively looking for work ~5M 
+ Unemployment Rate = (Unemployed People)/(Actual Labor Force) * 100 
                    = (5M)/(155M)*100 
                    = ~9.7%

+ Does not account people entering and exiting labor force which can
drastically affect the unemployment rate. 


Vid 3: Traditional IRA (Individual Retirement Account)  
-------
+ Each individual can invest up to certain limit each year based on age.
This limit is set by IRA and is usually high for people older than 50 yrs. 

+ The money contributed to IRA is pre-taxed and will be taxed only when
taking it out. 

+ There is a penalty of 10% for early withdrawl of IRA money. Cut off date
is 59.5yrs. 


Case Study: 
----- 
An individual with income in 32% tax bracket contributs $5000 to IRA. How
does he fare contributing (& investing) through IRA versus investing by
himself (without IRA). 

                                IRA                     No IRA 
                             ---------               ------------
Starting Amount                $5000                $5000 * 32% = $3400

Invest in stock A
for 10yrs and amount 
doubles                       $10,000                 $6800

After tax, amount left        $10,000               $6800 - ($3400*15%)
                           (won't pay tax           = $6290
                           because money is        (15% tax on $3400
                           still with IRA)           capital gains)  

Invest in stock B 
for 10yrs and amount 
doubles                       $20,000                  $12,580 


After tax, amount left        $20,000             $12,580 - ($6290*15%) 
                                                  = $11,636.50 

If you are over 59.5yrs 
now and eligible to 
withdraw. Say you earn 
much less now and fall 
in 25% tax bracket

------------------------------------------------------------------------
After tax, amount left        $15,000                 $11,636.50 
------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is made up scenario and most likely/probable one. 


Vid 4: The rule of 72 for compound interest 
---------
+ A simple rule to describe how long does it take for a principal amount
to double, given an interest rate R%: 72/R 
        Ex: R = 10% per annum. 
            It takes 7.2yrs to double the principal amount. 

            R = 10% per month. 
            It takes 7.2months to double. 

+ Actual formula: 
        Let P0 = principal amount right now. 
        Let P1 = Total amount after 1 year. 
        Let Pn = Total amount after n years. 
        Let R  = Interest rate per year. 

        Pn = P0 + P1 + P2 + ... 
           = P0(1+R/100)^n 


Vid 5: Term and Whole Life Insurance Policies
--------- 
+ Term Insurace: Policy on life for a certain term (say 10yrs). 
        - Pay yearly premium of, say, $500 for 10yrs for a payoff to
          beneficiary upon death within 10yrs. 
        - If no death then you loose whole money. 
        - If the term length is longer, premiums are higher due to higher
          probability of death. 
        - Premiums go up with age. 
        - This plan is not available after a certain age (like 70yrs or
          so). 

+ Life Insurace: Policy taken out for the whole life. 
        - Premiums are much higher than Term Insurance. 
        - Payout is after death to beneficiary. 
        - Optional savings plan associated with Life Insurance where a
          certain % interest is given on your premium. 
        - If you opt out of LI policy before death, you can take out the
          savings at a certain fee. 
        - However, upon death, only the Insurance payout will be provided
          to beneficiary. The cash savings is lost and will not be paid to
          beneficiary. 


Vid 6: Roth IRA
----------
+ Named after William Roth, Delaware Senator who proposed this bill. 
+ Roth IRA is post tax investment. 
+ Principal can be withdrawn anytime without penalty. 
+ If more than principal is withdrawn (if principal increases) then 10%
penalty and income tax is applied. 
+ After 59.5yrs, only income tax is applied on amount (except principal).  




                        Traditional IRA         Roth IRA 
                        --------------------------------
Initial: $5000             $5000               $3400 (at 32% tax)         
deposit                (tax deferred) 

Investment doubles         $10000              $6800 
but stays in IRA 

Investment doubles         $20000              $13600 
again but stays in IRA

Ex 1: 
Withdraw $3400 before   $3400-($340 penalty)    $3400-(1088 at 32% tax)
59.5yrs                 - ($1088 at 32% tax)    = $2312
                        = $1972

Ex 2: 
Withdraw $4000 before   $4000-($400 penalty)    No tax on $3400. 
59.5yrs                 -($1280 at 32% tax)     On $600, 10% penalty +  
                        = $2320                 32% income tax = $348 
                                                Total = $3748. 

Ex 3: 
Withdraw after 59.5yrs  $15000                  No tax on $3400 + 
at 25% tax rate         (after tax)             25% on $10200 
                                                = $11050
