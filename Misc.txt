@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@     TOR    @@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
Tor:
- Passing traffic by bouncing them across various Tor nodes across the globe.
  Minimum, Tor traffic passes through 3 nodes: Entry/Gaurd, Relay & Exit.

- Traffic is encrypted in layers (like Onion) before it is sent out from source.
    # of layers of encryption = # of Tor nodes traffic is passing.

- As traffic passes through each node, that node knows how to decrypt it's layer
  and forward to next Tor node.


@@@@@@@@    MUNICIPAL SOLID WASTE MANAGEMENT IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES @@@@@@@@

Facts:
- Humans generate 7-10 billion tons of waste per year worldwide.
- Waste from 2 billion people is not collected from their homes and
  neighborhoods.
- By end of century, 83% of world population will be in Asia and Africa.
- There are 3 billion people who lack access to controlled disposal facilities.
- By 2030 there will be 40 megacities (cities with 10 million or more
  population). Of that 32 will be in Asia and Africa.


Municipal Waste Generation and Characterization:
- Estimating Lower Calorific Value (LCV)
    LCV = 40(a+b+c+d) + 90e - 46W
    LCV in kcal/kg
    a = Paper
    b = Textiles
    c = Wood and leaves
    d = Food waste
    e = Plastic and rubber
    W = Water
    all of above in % of wet weight.

- Incineration without adding fuel requies LCV > 1000 kcal/kg
- Incineration with energy recovery requires LCV > 1500-1650 kcal/kg

@@@@@@@@@@@@@   Open/R  @@@@@@@@@@@@@@

- Build a routing _platform_ and not a routing _protocol_
- Applications are built on top of this platform in C++. Routing is one
  application.
- Each node in this network as following 4 components:
    * Decision
    * FIB
    * KV-Store
    * Link Monitor
- Zero MQ for message passing between nodes.
- Thrift: Message encoding. Populat open source library.

- Key-Value Store:
    - Key = Strings, Value = Thrift objects

Optimization in KV Store:
- Group nodes in to clusters
- STP within clusters
- Between clusters, similar to BGP's path tracing mechanism is used.

Scaling in KV Store:
-

Neighbor Discovery:
- Runs as a separate process.
- Works on link-level
