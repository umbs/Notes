@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@     TOR    @@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
Tor:
- Passing traffic by bouncing them across various Tor nodes across the globe.
  Minimum, Tor traffic passes through 3 nodes: Entry/Gaurd, Relay & Exit.

- Traffic is encrypted in layers (like Onion) before it is sent out from source.
    # of layers of encryption = # of Tor nodes traffic is passing.

- As traffic passes through each node, that node knows how to decrypt it's layer
  and forward to next Tor node.


@@@@@@@@    MUNICIPAL SOLID WASTE MANAGEMENT IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES @@@@@@@@

Facts:
- Humans generate 7-10 billion tons of waste per year worldwide.
- Waste from 2 billion people is not collected from their homes and
  neighborhoods.
- By end of century, 83% of world population will be in Asia and Africa.
- There are 3 billion people who lack access to controlled disposal facilities.
- By 2030 there will be 40 megacities (cities with 10 million or more
  population). Of that 32 will be in Asia and Africa.


Municipal Waste Generation and Characterization:
- Estimating Lower Calorific Value (LCV)
    LCV = 40(a+b+c+d) + 90e - 46W
    LCV in kcal/kg
    a = Paper
    b = Textiles
    c = Wood and leaves
    d = Food waste
    e = Plastic and rubber
    W = Water
    all of above in % of wet weight.

- Incineration without adding fuel requies LCV > 1000 kcal/kg
- Incineration with energy recovery requires LCV > 1500-1650 kcal/kg

@@@@@@@@@@@@@   Open/R  @@@@@@@@@@@@@@

- Build a routing _platform_ and not a routing _protocol_
- Applications are built on top of this platform in C++. Routing is one
  application.
- Each node in this network as following 4 components:
    * Decision
    * FIB
    * KV-Store
    * Link Monitor
- Zero MQ for message passing between nodes.
- Thrift: Message encoding. Populat open source library.

- Key-Value Store:
    - Key = Strings, Value = Thrift objects

Optimization in KV Store:
- Group nodes in to clusters
- STP within clusters
- Between clusters, similar to BGP's path tracing mechanism is used.

Scaling in KV Store:
-

Neighbor Discovery:
- Runs as a separate process.
- Works on link-level

@@@@@@@@@@@@@   Networks Illustrated: Principles w/o Calculus @@@@@@@@@@@@@@

Lesson 1:
---
- 8 principles in this course:
- Sharing (network medium) is hard
- Consensus is hard
    * Referral system.
    * Auction system with systems bidding.
    * Voting system.
- Crowds are wise
    * Amazon trying to solve Rating problem.
    * Netflix trying to solve Recommendation problem.

- Crowds are NOT wise:
    * Information cascade can happen and crowds may not think for themselves.

- Network is Expensive:
- Network of Networks:
    * internet is combination of many networks within networks.

- Layers on Layers:
- Bigger & Bigger:


Lesson 2:
---
- Mobile penetration rate:
    # of mobile subscriptions/total population

- Multiple Access
    * Morse devised Morse Code to use Telegraph Cable to transmit ./- notation.
    * Bell devised multiple transmitters and recievers on same Telegraph Cable.

- Frequency Division Multiple Access (FDMA)
    * N MHz = N cycles per second.

- 0G
    MTS (1946) - Mobile Telephone System
        * FDMA system
        * An operator was required
    IMTS (1964) - Improved MTS
        * No operator required
    DynaTAC (1973)
        * From Qualcomm

- Attenuation
    WiFi is in unlicensed frequency
    Cellular is in licensed frequency
    Attenuation is decaying of signal over distance

- Cell & 1G
    + Due to attenuation, we divided regions in to cells of hexagon shape.
    + Cell towers are at the center of hexagons and base stations at
      intersection of edges of hexagons. With this design, a base station can
      serve 3 cells.
    + Frequency ranges in one cell doesn't match with next cell to avoid
      interference, but they can match with non-adjacent cells. This is done for
      spectral efficiency.

- Frequency Reuse Factor
    + Number of frequency bands used.

- 1G
    + Cells were used first time in 1G.
    + AMPS (1986) - Advanced Mobile Phone System. Operated in 800 MHz band
      system.
    + Cellular technology transformed from 0G to 1G.
    + First operated in Chicago with 90 people and 10 cells. Demonstrated
      feasibility.

- 2G
    + Migration from Analog to Digital is the most significant change from 1G to
      2G
    + Digital screens started appearing.
    + Texting was a feature.
    + 2000 was the year when 2G came.

- TDMA (Time Division)
    + TDMA uses Frequency Division with Time Division.
    + Why didn't we do this before? Analog signalling didn't allow this.
    + Sometimes called F/TDMA.

- GSM (Global System for Mobile Communication) 1982
    + First system to employ TDMA
    + 3x more than Analog capacity.
    + GSM was quickly adopted by Europe.

- CDMA (Code Division Multiple Access) 1988
    + CTIA (Cellular Technology Industries Assoc) wanted 10x improvement.
    + Qualcomm had a different idea. They added a different dimension to time
      and frequency. A code is added with each communication.

- Codes?
    + Along with digital data signal, a "spreading code" is used to transmit
      data. data signal x spreading code is transmitted.
    + Receiver uses spreading code to decode data signal.
    + Designing spreading code is very tough.
    + It needs to have a property called "Orthogonal" that two spreading codes
      should cancel out.

- Qualcomm's CDMA improvements
    + Supposedly 40x improvement (theoretically). But in reality, much less.
    + CTIA voted Qualcomm's CDMA as a 2G standard in US.

- Near-Far Problem
    + Channel quality depends on distance from base station and obstacles in
      between.
    + How much power is needed to transmit data? It's measure in Watts (W). In
      fact, phones need power in milli Watts (mW) to transmit data.
    + Phones that are farther from BS transmit data at, say, 20 mW and by the
      time it reaches BS, it's say 2 mW. While those near to BS may be received
      at 10 mW. It is important to make these signals reach BS at constant
      power. There's easy algo for this.
    + BS tells phones at what power to transmit so it receives at constant
      power.
    + Transmit Power Control (TCP) Algorithm to solve NF Problem.

- Signal Quality
    + Power is not the problem. Quality is.
    + Increasing power by a phone causes interference.
    + Signal to Interference Ratio (SIR).

- DPC (Distributed Power Control)
    + Cells transmit data to BS. BS sends SIR to phones. Phones adjust power.
    + This process iterates and finally converges on a power.
