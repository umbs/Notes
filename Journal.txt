    - Effective Tax Rate = Taxes Paid/Total Income
    - Go to https://decode.tax and upload old tax returns and they'll
      immediately tell effective tax rate. Not good idea.

#facial #ipvs #loadbalancer
- Load Balancer PoC started working. YAY! Thanks to Zycada team: Roy and Ganu.
    - IPVS with 2 'Real Servers' started working.
    - Must configure Virtual IP (VIP) on Real Servers, on loopback (or dummy)
      interface. This way, when they receive the packets, they know it is for
      them.
        - Zycada team asked us to disable ARP, but not sure why.
        - We must also not disable ARP for ALL interfaces.
    - On IPVS server, configure rules using internal IP address (192.168.xx).
      Do not do it for public IP or Real Servers.
    - On IPVS, we used 'Direct Routing', some times called 'Gateway Routing'.
      This is default setting. Other options are IP-IP or NAT (masquerading).

- Eric Platt and Karthik Kumar and I joined a call for auto scaling results.
    - On setting the threshold to 100% CPU and pumping the data plane traffic,
      all 6 CPU cores were running at 100%. But auto scale did not happen. In
      fact, the auto scale step function itself did not get triggered.
    - While the tests were running the threshold limits were removed/deleted from DB. Immediately the auto scale step function triggered.

- Regular kids drop and pick up and RSM.


2023, Nov 13 (Mon)
- Standup. Started writing Load Balancer document.
- Discussions with Alok Ranjan on AWS CSP.
- Long conversation with Samhitha Sathyanarayana.

- GP Autoscale issue investigation
    - 1000 compute region is not being "picked up" during autoscale. Flow:
        0) gp_auto_auto_scheduler lambda
        1) Get `dr_feature_state` from `global_settings` table. It is set to `disable`
        2) Could not query the TraceMasterModelGlobal due to missing required keys. ???
        3) Insert following record into trace_master:
          tenant_id: 0
          trace_id: 968579eb-571d-4f2a-9ee6-1571e907a94d,
          type: AutoScaleUpdateSchedule
          type_id: 1695667541

          Successfully done: Row ID: 8375378
        4) SELECT compute_region_id, timezone FROM region_master where edge_location_region_id = compute_region_id
        These are where edge == compute. Schedule is updated in these regions.
            1000 is Compute region (OSP)
            200 is not Compute region (GCP)
        5) Check against LOCAL_UPDATE_HOUR env variable. If not set, only
        collect only those Compute regions which is 2AM local time. Obviously
        San Jose will not be picked during day time. It will be picked at 2AM
        on Tuesday.

GPGW Upgrade on Openstack - Status
-----
- Brought up GPGW with version: PA-VM-SaaS-10.2.6-c50.sb28_saas
- Successfully upgraded to version: PA-VM-SaaS-10.2.8-c50.saas
- Triggered upgrade workflow using gp_pinned_instance_upgrade_action lambda
- Validations:
    - New GPGW got vmid, serial_number, public_ip, node_fqdn.
    - Successfully connected to GPGW in Openstack using GP client on my laptop.

- Meeting with Ravi Bhavsar, Mohan Chandrasekar, Tejas Patel to clarify questions on GPFW
  upgrades. Asked following questions:
        1) During creation of GPGW, what goes into deciding to spawn a new GP
        Portal?
          - GPPT bring up is "hard coded". One in each theatre in Americas.
            Similarly across other regions of the world.
          - Ask Hao Long on exact flow. How GPPT and GPGW recognize each other.

        2) How does GP portal know (or have) list of GPGW currently running.
          - Sam as above.

        3) I have 2 GPGW and 2 GPPT in GCP. I'm not able to ping their Public
        IP (External IP) addresses from my laptop, why? But I'm able to ping
        Public IP of GPGW spun up in Openstack.
          - VMs were shutdown. Bummer.

        4) `node_fqdn` and `public_ip` on GPGW - what is their relationship.
        After upgrade, will node_fqdn be same as that on old GPGW? I found a
        GPGW that had NULL `node_fqdn`, but all other fields were present
        (vmid, serial_number, public_ip etc). What could have happened there?
          - saas_agent has a logic to compute `node_fqdn` and gets public IP
            from saas-infra. Then it registers with Route53 resolver. This
            applies to even GPGW on GCP and Openstack.

        5) Will public DNS servers be able to resolve this `node_fqdn`? When
        GPGW comes up for first time, who is assigning this `node_fqdn` and who
        is registering this with public DNS servers?
          - Yes. See above.

        6) Today, we have 1 GPGW per Tenant per region. If I want to support 2
        GPGW per Tenant, what and where should I investigate?
          - This is largely solved problem. GPGW do scale up. We have customers
            with more than 10 GPGW in some regions.



- CSP meeting for FUTURE_AMEND messages with Manish Misra, Raghav Bandla, Blake
  Weiss, Seshapani D and Davi G. Questions:

            Hello All,

            Here are the notes from meetings with IT and UAT teams regarding new asks for Flex Credits (FUTURE_AMEND, FUTURE_RENEW).

            Attendees: Seshapani D, Manish M, Raghav B, Blake W, Bhaskar U

            Recording: https://paloaltonetworks.zoom.us/rec/share/1knyIyyqqkwZZzsS5-azPIfdstLyXvEQ7tq0RHx6qgeaHw21vMhLag6qzyGlXaVg.zQpHgTY6ZD9qw145?startTime=1695413246000
            Passcode: ?g5S%S49Ms


            Applies to all event_types:
            ---------------------------
            - When FUTURE_RENEW or FUTURE_AMEND quoting happens, Product can expect to receive 3 messages:
                - On the day of order quoting with event_type = FUTURE_AMEND (or FUTURE_RENEW)
                - 3 days before order start date with event_type = FUTURE_AMEND (or FUTURE_RENEW)
                - On the start date with event_type = AMEND (or RENEW)
                - If the quoting happens less than 3 days, only two messages will come to Product.

            - Microservice is not expecting any ACK for FUTURE_AMEND or FUTURE_RENEW. Product can even drop/ignore the message. However, it is good to have this for auditing purposes. Other products, use FUTURE_AMEND/FUTURE_RENEW to apply the credits on the start date. They do not rely on AMEND/RENEW messages.


            RENEW, FUTURE_RENEW:
            --------------------
                - FUTURE_RENEW is sent with a future start date and usually before the current contract expires. This is to maintain continuity of the Customers license.
                - RENEW message is sent at 12AM PST on the start-date of the contract.
                - Payload for both these messages will be exactly like BUY payload, except that start-date and end-date will change and quantity can also change.
                - However, for the RENEW message, response from Product is captured in this Confluence page. Only one message must be published to Microservices.
                    - https://confluence-dc.paloaltonetworks.com/display/NOVA/V1.4#V1.4-Renew:
                - RENEW cannot come before a BUY message. If it happens, throw an error message.
                    - https://confluence-dc.paloaltonetworks.com/display/NOVA/V1.4#V1.4-Error:
                    - event_type: "ERROR"
                    - error_type: "bad_input"
                    - response_description: "error description"
                    - request_payload: "attach payload"
                - Multiple FUTURE_RENEWALs are not supported.



            AMEND, FUTURE_AMEND:
            --------------------
                - FUTURE_AMEND payload is exactly like AMEND payload.
                - No acknowledgement is required after receiving FUTURE_AMEND.
                - Ignore the start dates on the AMEND message. Other Products ignore it. "Blindly" apply the Quantity and End-date from AMEND to the current contract.


            EXPIRE:
            -------
                - When a contract is completed, MS sends an EXPIRE message.
                - A customer cannot cancel any order (FUTURE_AMEND, FUTURE_RENEW) after paying for it. There is a separate process for it. So, need not worry about receiving FUTURE_AMEND, but not receiving AMEND later.


            Thank you,
            Bhaskar

GPGW Upgrade on Openstack - Status
-----
- Brought up GPGW with version:
- Triggered upgrade workflow using version:
- I triggered this from AWS lambda function gp_pinned_instance_upgrade_action
- Found an issue in ami_mapping table. The version I upgraded to was present in
  Openstack (Shikhar uploaded it). It was present in version_mapping, but not
  present in ami_mapping. Because of this provisioning_service failed to create
  Terraform script and deploy. Vikram pointed out.
- Upgrade started working after that fix.


- I've lot of questions:
    - How does GP portal know (or have) list of GPGW currently running. What's
      the mapping between them.
    - node_fqdn and public_ip on GPGW - what is their relationship. After
      upgrade, with node_fqdn remain same? I found a GPGW that had NULL
      node_fqdn, but all other fields were present (vmid, serial_number,
      public_ip etc). What could have happened there?
    - Will public DNS servers be able to resolve this node_fqdn to IP mapping?
      Who is registering this FQDN to DNS servers?
    - If I want to support 2 GPGW per Tenant, what and where should I investigate?




2023, Sep 20 (Wed)
- Trying to understand why GPGW did not come up.
    - In Orchestrator logs there is an error: `ddns_version` field.
    - Team is fixing it. I'll redeploy GPGW.

- GPGW was not coming up on dev10. Emergency team meeting to resolve the issue.
  It was resolved by Justin and Shikhar late at night.


2023, Sep 19 (Tue)
- Debugging session of a CSP AMEND issue.
    - We are seeing 2 messages (FUTURE_AMEND and AMEND). We ignore the first.
    - AMEND has a different start date.

2023, Sep 08 (Fri)
- Identified an issue in Staging and worked with SRE to resolve it.
    - WALLE-1121
    - In an earlier WALLE-1039, we decided to have non-Prod settings in
      Staging. It appears that SRE updated it in only one slot.

- Investigated request from Ravi Pegada
    - Customer has a 'Classic Table' in their Log Analytics storage.
    - They want to change it to 'Azure Table'. Is there a plan for us to do it?


- Met Deepthi K J from DP team and this is the feedback I received:
    - Instead of 'show system disk-usage', collect output of 'show system resources' and use `available` memory metric. It has more significance.
    - From Jailed environment, inside billing plugin, we cannot run 'show system disk-usage'.
    - Move the code to a common module, such as VM plugin agent, where available memory is set as SDB variable. Call that variable in Azure plugin.
    - In VM plugin agent, call the 'show' command every 5th minute instead of every minute, to reduce the resource constraints.
    - Showed how to run UTs using `vm-dev` tool.
    - This PR must be raised on `main` branch first. Then merged one-by-one into various branches, including nebula. This is recommended process.

- Take Home Warranty
-----------------------------------------------------------------
- Prepared a lot for meeting with Chandra R and Shiva on CSP for AWS. In the
  end, it turned out to be simple meeting to understand how CSP Account Id is
  got in Azure and can we do similar thing on AWS.

    ---------------------------------------------

    - Prepared following notes for the meeting:
            Agenda:
            - Overview of how CSP works in AWS today.
                - Relationship between CustomerId, Tenant, Organization and Users.

            Questions on PRD requirements
            ----
            PRD Task: Customers can choose to set up a CSP account later.
                - How exactly does this workflow pan out?
                - When Customer chooses to register later for CSP, how will they do?

            PRD Task: Get Customer/Company's address and pass it to IT. How to do it? Today, we
            run Business Analytics on Tableau. Company address is available there. This
            data is also on *some* data lake (CDL?).
                - Is Tableau the source of truth for billing address? How quickly is this data
                  available for CSP to consume?
                - Today, are there APIs for CSP to call in Tableau?
                - Should this be obtained from AWS?


            PRD Task: A banner informing users to register with CSP.
                - CNGFW must provide an API to let UI know if a Customer registered with
                  CSP or not.

            PRD Task: Users trying to link Panorama must register with CSP first.
                - I'm unfamiliar with Panorama + CSP integration. Overview?


            PRD Task: If a new user is added who chooses to map to CSP Tenant, all
            existing users on Tenant also need to be auto registered.
                - This is CSP teams work. But how will they do this?

            PRD Task: All Tenants must be migrated from Essential to Enhanced/Premium plan.
                - This is unfamiliar area for me.

- Talking to QA about Flex Credit bug: FWAAS-9396
    - Spent so much time fixing their environ and helping QA :(

- Reading up on vm-series code to understand where to put my changes.
- Reading up a lot about pytest/fixtures/parameterization
    - https://medium.com/opsops/deepdive-into-pytest-parametrization-cb21665c05b9
    - Deep dive in above blog.


- Donated blood at work (B+ group)
- Took Aarushi to Nalpad Academy for swim competition.


2023, Aug 16 (Wed)
- Spoke to Ranjan Panchalwar. Long meeting :(
    - There is a "Proposed Time" concept in SteelBrick (SB)
        - We are not getting it.
    - Renewal with future start date.
        - BUY with future start date.
    - Updates to Alok Ranjan about discussions.

- Small meeting with Karthik Chandran to help him run UTs
- Slack discussions with Davi and Alok.
    - If BUY comes with a start date greater than end date of currently active
      BUY, reject it. It gets too complex.

- Intensely working on getting "Idempotent" changes into 1.7.1 branch
    - Got stuck in a silly bug during UT. Took me >1 hour for an obvious typo/bug.
    - But I swear UTs are so beneficial.
    - I have also started using pytest parameterization. It's so succint,
      beautiful and elegant.

- Alok requested that "CSP Account Name" fix to be done before Friday (Aug 18th)

2023, Aug 10 (Thu)
- Testing AMEND before demo at 10am
- Demo:
    - Address issue where AMEND comes with "end date" older than "current date".
    - Address use case where a second BUY comes after first BUY has expired.

- Investigating a Prod issue for Tenant: 1f8aefe1-eac8-4532-9c55-115d46c686ee
    - SubscriptionId: 43b3cddd-3ae6-42ab-a26f-51a3e22d91a8
    - BillingId: 67604ef0-5c8e-47e5-cc12-9262800b3914

    - CSP Data Collector is *always* sending address info for this Tenant.
    - CNGFW is receiving ACK for it.
    - But CSP Status is not changing.
    - When looking through logs, I see following:
        - "BillingIds: set() exists in CSV report."
        - How can there be empty set() in there?

- Meeting with Davi Gupta.
    - Have WALLE tickets for short time only. Do things *outside* WALLE and then finally open WALLE.
    - WALLE-1043 (closed)
    - WALLE-1042:
        - Create a new GCP subscription. Have a *future proof* name.
        - Ask Blake to send the messages.
        - Pull messages from UI and make sure messages are received.
        - Update WALLE where changes need to be made:
            - MP Func App
    - Multiple messages on Slack channel issue:
        - Product is *probably* publishing twice with billing address.
        - IT is replaying it back.
        - Product is NOT idempotent. This is causing the publish/consume cycle an infinite loop.
    - Did a code review with Davi for following PR
        - https://bitbucket.paloaltonetworks.local/projects/FWAAS/repos/fwaas/pull-requests/7241/overview
        - https://jira-hq.paloaltonetworks.local/browse/FWAAS-8805
            - Add ALL tests that QA must run and validate the change.

- PR with log prefix, removing "api_with_retries()" function
- Working with Lakshmi Prasanna, Murali Pulipati, Blake W
    - Duplicate messages on Slack.



2023, Aug 09 (Wed)
- Opened WALLE-1043
    - Client ID and Client Secret testing for SRE. Provided a python script to test this.
- Raise PR for CSP:
    - log prefix
    - remove api_retries() call
- Meeting with Satish Kumar Ganesan from GNS team
    - They do not have anything in Azure
    - They have a "GNS Hub" in each cloud.
    - They expose an interface to which clients forward the logs/metrics.
- Have been testing AMEND
- Meeting with Alex Berdan (GNS), Pradeep Kumar Vijaya Kumar (Garuda) and my team.
    - GNS has a Hub in Azure, in CentralUS and USWest2 regions (and may be more).
    - GNS will give a private address range (CIDR). CNGFW must put their Event Hub in this subnet.
    - CNGFW must route the metrics to the private endpoint given by GNS.
    - After CNGFW does pricing analysis, please share with GNS and Garuda. It
      will help GNS to figure out how to route traffic from GNS Hub on Azure to
      GCP (using express route, cloud interconnect, etc)

    Next Steps:
        - AI on CNGFW:
            - Put Event Hub in a Vnet and make sure it is *still working*.
            - Update GNS ticket with further details.
            - Update FS document with diagrams and architecture.
            - Do analysis on the pricing difference between Datadog and Garuda
              with above architecture in place.
                - This helps in understanding costs.
        - Once CNGFW is ready
            - Setup meeting with Infosec (Gurinder Singh, Surendra Narang), GNS
              (Alex Berdan, Satish Ganesan) and others
        - Implementation

      secret used to talk to GCP.
    - Helping Manasa Rengineni with CSP workflow.
    - SOLUTION: Environment variables in QA environment, for MP function app

          "Live Community" page.

        Thank you for attending Internal FS review and giving your feedback.
        1. How will Customer know when Thermite Cert fetch failed (or device registration)?
        >> For CloudSec, the health status changes to Yellow color. There is no easy way to indicate this in NetSec.
        2. Is there a provision to switch (Support Account Id) for existing Firewalls?
        >> This is WIP and will likely come in next release. Davi and team are in discussions with CSP/IT team to understand the unlink/de-register workflow and design a solution.

2023, Apr 13 (Thu)
----------------------------------------------------------------
                        COMPLETED
    - Create mock data and give to Parvathy
----------------------------------------------------------------
- Thermite Cert Tasks
    Design 1: Using Service Bus
        - MP Tasks:
            - Create Service Bus on MP with Blue and Green topics.
            - Write DB trigger function on `Subscriber` table. Only processes.
              `cspTenantId` and ignores everything else.
            - How does DB trigger function know which topic to push to?
              Environment variable with SRE_TENANTS on MP function app.
        - CP Tasks:
            - Service Bus triggered Azure function to consume message.
            - Write to all FWs in that `Resource` table for that TenantId and SubscriptionId.
            - First time sync between DBs:
                - If "Firewall Function App" was down and could not consume messages in Service Bus.
                - When Firewall Function App comes up, it would have lost all messages.
                - A sync between MP and CP CosmosDB is required.
            - Writes to `Resource` table triggers Azure Function
                --> Resource --> DB Trigger --> Orch

    Design 2: Timer tiggered Azure Function in CP
        - CP Tasks:

Dev complete and QA handoff on May 8th


High Level Workflow:
--------------------
FW Bootstrap and CSP Tenant Id is available in CNGFW:
    - On bootstrap, FW always calls Access Broker (ACB) to register the device and fetch Thermite Cert.
    - ACB successfully does both.

FW Bootstrap and CSP Tenant Id is NOT available in CNGFW:
    - On bootstrap, FW always calls Access Broker (ACB) to register the device and fetch Thermite Cert.
    - ACB returns an error that CSP Tenant Id does not exist.
    - FW will continue functioning and will be notified when CSP Tenant Id is available in CNGFW.

Bootstrap includes both cases - new FW creation and autoscale.


Unregistered running FW and CSP Tenant Id becomes available:

CNGFW can do QA handoff on May 8th, Monday
Dev Tasks
    - A timer triggered Azure function running every, say, 10 mins.
    - A new container in CP called: TenantDetails (containing CSP Tenant Id)
    - AzF checks `TenantDetails` for Tenants with missing CSP Tenant Id. For those tenants:
        - Lookup MP Subscriber table and update `TenantDetails` container with CSP Tenant Id.
        - Update `Commit` table with CSP Tenant Id. Add new `action` to this workflow to send CSP Tenant Id to FW instances. This is very similar to existing workflow.

    - Still to flush out details
        - Who populates TenantDetails table first time?
        - Blue/Green scenarios, are all edge and transition cases covered?

    - Unit Tests

Integration Testing

FS Review (?)

Demo: On or before May 8th




2023, Apr 12 (Wed)

- Design Discussions: Thermite Certificate MP to CP control flow.
    - with Davi and Anant.
    - We must do PoC of MP to CP service bus + topic creation.
    - PoC of flow between CP to FW, with new notification message.

- I've been trying to get my UTs to work.

2023, Apr 11 (Tue)
- Thermite Cert design discussions:
    Date: April 11th, 2023 (10am IST)
    Attendeeds: Karthik K, Yita C, Ramesh P, Anant S, Bhaskar U

    - Proposed workflow when `cspTenantId` becomes available looks good. Use `AntiVirusUpdate` pipeline to implement this.
    - Do not send `cspTenantId` in User Data. It'll trigger a rolling upgrade. There's some uncertainty if this is correct. But the team agreed there is no need for FW to know `cspTenantId`, at least for now
    - Plugin prefers NOT to call Access Broker if CNGFW does not have cspTenantId because this will increase boot up time. This results in two workflows:
        - cspTenantId is not available during FW bootstrap but becomes available later:
            - When `cspTenantId` becomes available, write it to the Resource table.
            - A new 'pipeline', which is very similar to AntiVirus update, will send notification to FW.
            - On FW, this will trigger Device Registration and Thermite Cert creation workflow.
        - cspTenantId is available during FW bootstrap:
            - if cspTenantId is present in the Resource table, along with FW create, send a notification to FW trigger Device Reg and Cert fetch.
            - The APIs provided by IT are synchronous, blocking APIs. So, Access Broker calls will be blocked until response is available.

    @Karthik Krishnan Chandran, @Yita Chung, @Ramesh Pavadai, @Anant Raj Singh are there any loose ends we need to close?

- Discussions with Bishnu about logprofile doubts. How to keep DB changes backward compatible.
- Added retry mechanism in API calls to Marketplace.
    - Access Token, Query Id, Report Id, Report Generation

- Adding more UTs to CSP.
    - Stuck in getting first one working.

- Pickup Akshay from Prestige Mayberry. OMG, it took 3 hours to drive there and
  back, with a visit to Gas Station.


- Meeting with MSFT team about CSV files
    - DateAcquired meaning.
    - Missing data in 3/6 months CSV report.
    - Discrepencies between column names:
       - MarketplaceSubscriptionId != BillingId

    Notes:
        - Explanation for `DateAcquired`: This field is "Date when Customer was
          Acquired" for the first time Customer could have purchased _any_
          Azure product. For all entries in the CSV file, this value is will
          remain constant for that customer.
        - TIMESPAN of 6_MONTHS or LIFETIME applies to `DateAcquired` field.
          That's why we were not seeing results for on 6_MONTH query.
        - 'Marketplace Subscription Id' in FW UI page is showing up as
          `ReferenceId` in CSV file.
        - ReferenceId's are missing in CSV file when Marketplace Subscription
          Status: NotStarted. This *may* be an issue for PAN, but Bhaskar to
          confirm with Davi and share here.


2023, Apr 04 (Tue)

    - Having hard time managing perception about my work.
    - Long conversations with Alok R that management thinks poorly of me.
    - Unfortunately, Shiva thinks badly about my work and I feel the opinion
      was very quickly formed.
    - I've to get out of this negative spiral of poor performance. I'll no
      longer focus on my own performance, but focus on delivering results with
      high quality. Things will take care of itself.

- Demo dry run at 9:30pm. Found issues on CSP side.
    - CSP: Activation email not received.

2023, Mar 31 (Fri)
#hyderabad #bengaluru
- Return to Bangalore.

- Meeting with Davi, Shiva:
    - Issues with CSP so far.
    - Changes in Azure AD <--> Okta <--> CSP. Okta cannot have dynamic bookmark
      link to redirect to Azure AD. So, design change. Now call CSP directly.
      This should make design easier and same as AWS and vm-series.


- Slack messages exchange with Madhava:
    1. 48 hour delay: @Davi Gupta is saying we can directly send the message to
    the topic with PANW MP billing details. This is ok for initial CSP demo but
    subsequent demo from our team we need to have this done via portal.

    Madhava, what Davi meant is this. For next demo, we will do it from the
    Portal. But, we will send mock billing address to IT/Microservices to
    generate CSP Serial Number and CSP Tenant Id. There will be another demo at
    end of April. That'll be with 48 hour constraint in place. We will do that
    with *actual* billing address.

    2. PaloAlto domain email address not accepted by CSP - We are planning to
    use dummy domain address . This might work for sign up flow . (ie. New CSP
    account & user creation) but we are not clear how we will test existing
    user logining on to CSP from portal afterr sign up is done from dummy
    domain.  @Davi Gupta mentioned CSP UI experience will be modified but I am
    not sure if that is a concrete plan.

    We must ask CSP team for this.


    3. We have CSP on-boarding workflow ; but there is no details about
    customer off-boarding; How are we going to remove the customer from CSP
    side. Not sure if this is an actual prod requirement. But because we have
    only 1 tenant to test it we might excercise this flow as part of our
    testing.

    This is no different than CSP off-boarding in AWS or other projects. I don't think this is priority for us now.

    4. @Shiva Chikkamath - I remember in last program meeting we concluded
    there will be three demos. Can you please list them out here with the
    dates, content planned and the owner for these demos.  - cc @Maheshwar
    Kannan

    There are two demo's planned.
        - Demo1: E2E without integration with Marketplace API. So, mock billing
          address will be passed to IT/Microservice. Planned as soon as
          Hanfords team is ready.

        - Demo2: E2E with integration with Marketplace API. We will demo with
          real billing address in this demo. Tentatively end of April.

#nps
- Applied to NPS for both kids. Need to submit these forms:

    The documents mentioned below need to be attested by both the parents and a
    hard copy is to be carried at the time of interaction:
        1. Registration Form
        2. Invite for Interaction
        3. Copies of marks card attested by the parents. This is applicable to
            Class 2- Mid-term marks card of Class 1
            Class 3- Mid-term marks card of Class 2 and final marks card of Class 1
            Class 4 and above- Mid-term marks card of current class and final marks card of last two years

        Incomplete forms will be rejected.

        - Registration for admission does not ensure an admission. Admission is
          granted on merit and availability of seats.
        - Admission process for classes 1 to 7 is conducted before granting
          admission.
        - An annual fee increase of 10 to 15 percent is effective to offset the
          increasing expenditure by way of salary, maintenance, material and
          other expenditure. National Public School East is a private unaided
          self-financing institution.
        - If an intimation is not received from the school, it should be
          presumed that there is no vacancy during the year and no separate
          intimation will be sent to the applicants who are not selected.
        - I have read the registration form of National Public School, East and
          I fully agree to abide by them as long as my child is a student at
          this school if selected.


- Meeting with Davi. Suggested improvements to FS document.
    - Don't  use `d /Users/bupadhyayula/Notes
    cd /Users/bupadhyayula/practice
    ed --force flag.
    * Misunderstood service_version and version in cmdline argument to
      scheduler.py. How did it work during 1.5.0 testing?
    * FW's were shutdown (nightly thing). Power on and test.
    * CommitAll was failing. Figured it's an issue with: security policies,
      cloud transformation. Debugged with Bhoop Singh & Soundarya
    * Finally, conclusion was to upgrade Panorama to 9.0 from 8.1
    * I'll not do it. Just delete security policy and CommitAll is now working.
    * HA state is established.

- After above flow, got called by QA that MU onboarding is failing. Fortunately,
  it's not. Deployment Manager took very long time.

- Resume testing step function using scheduler.py
    * STF was failing right off the bat. Could not understand why. Consumed
      couple of hours and figured that ${account} should be replaced with actual
      number.
    * Simranjit gave code for his part.
    * Made good progress on Unit Testing code. More fixes (minor) needed.

  branches.
- Handoff to QA. Closely following progress.


2019, Dec 18 (Wed)
- Kala and family visited office around 6pm. Showed them the place and I went
  home with them.


- Many discussions with QA about CYR-9872 bug. We have to put in a fix to enable
  QA to switch between 1.5.0 and 1.5.1.
- Worked on a DIT-5446, where boto3 credentials are failing on AWS FW. Talked to
  AWS support and found that it's underlying hardware/VM issue.
- Spent lot of time understanding CYR-9872 and how it's happening. Figured out
  call stack and realized we cannot support this for QA easily.
    * So, I put a setting/value combo in global_settings table.
    * Orchestrator will read it and decide to execute 1.5.1 code or not.


2019, Dec 17 (Tue)

- Christmas dance performance by Akshay at Rainbow

- Improvements and bug fixes to 3 computes region code. Specifically, fixing
  following:
    * old_region and region must reflect proper values in cust_topo.
    * Osaka (1.5.0) -> Osaka (1.5.1) -> Tokyo must keep FW in Tokyo.
    * Then, moving it back to Osaka should kill old FW and create new FW. This
      is not happening.
    * All other edge location changes are working.

2019, Dec 11 (Wed)
#carpetshampoo #WFH
- Up at 2am or something. Slept again at 5am.

- Identified issue in logger.py file that was NOT printing file names.
- Tried to understand workflow for cust_topology redesign.
- Tested MU deletion bug (CYR-9772) where dynamic instance is not getting
  deleted. It is indeed happening, but I still don't know why. Will fix later.


2019, Dec 10 (Tue)

- Meetings with Prabhakar on providing spot fixes for CYR-9747 (edge relocation
  issue). Lessons to be learnt here and made a note.
    * Focus on delivering feature, with quality.
- Looked in to changes that must be merged in to kiev saas. Everything is
  there.
- Side project: Update dbaccess clientlib API to have 3 retries on connection
  timeout.
    * This requires testing
    * I looked in to 'p4 shelve' for this, but not too happy with solution

- Autoscale bug (CYR-9772). QA env (rundeck itself) is in messy state. It cannot
  pull latest builds. Therefore, my fixes for 9763 (ensuring double quotes)
  could not be applied and tested.


2019, Dec 9 (Mon)
#guruji

- Meetings with Prabhakar and PLM (Saurabh Dixit) about 9747 bug. Release date
  is moved to Jan 7th. So, redesign DB to fix all issues. This includes:
- Worked on 9763, where egress_ip_list was written with single/double quotes
  that's messing up in saas_agent.
    * Understood JSON module and figured solution
- Committed code in main, devel2 branches.


ADD:
    * add 'old_region' column in cust_topology in alter_tables.sql file.
    * Any change to location in Panorama config, will add old region in this
      column and new region in 'region' column.
    * 'process_onboarding' step function must populate this column in
      cust_topology.
    * 'check_region_change' method in orchestrator.py must be fixed to reflect
      it.

MODIFY/DELETE:
    * Undo new column (past_compute) to region_master table.
    * Undo 'check_region_change' method in orchestrator.py
    * Undo 'past_compute' field in CustNodeModel

  pulled unrelated instances as a result.


2019, Dec 5 (Thu)
- Up at 4am and watched iOS videos.

- Pair program with Tejas and resolved 9686 blocker bug (4 issues found while
  deleting and edge location).
- Punted 9747 to Prabhakar.
- Spent lot of time analyzing new design to fix 9686:
    * We must have 'old_edge_region' column in cust_topology table.

2019, Dec 4 (Wed)
#warroom #office #guruji #facial
- Watched Youtube video about 20+ developer channels that Traversy Media guy
  follows
- Dropped Guruji off to Shailendraji's home.
- Facial at night. Must reduce and/or have more self control.


- Up at a Godly hour (2am) and watched iOS videos.
- Responded to couple of emails and setup early morning meeting.
- Quite intense meeting for 2 hours addressing following topics:
    * Remapping of new edge locations for 1.6.0 (19 edges)
    * List all tasks involved for that
    * Tejas agreed to look at R53 entries issue. If an MU is deleted from an
      edge, it's R53 entries is not getting deleted.
    * Discussions with Nilesh, Julian Zhong, and QA team about changes to
      gpclient_region_external_mapping and types_master table.
    * Suggestions were made to changes I did. I undid them and committed to main
      and devel2 branches.

- War Room with Tejas Patel and Madhava to get following:
    * Deleting an edge location should delete its r53 entries and forwarding rules.
        - Tejas had code in local env that was not checked in.
        - After checking in, this issue is resolved.
    * Old compute advertises r53 entries for all edge regions. So, if a new edge
      is coming up after upgrade, it must first delete old r53.
    * Did PoC on QA environment. Tested thoroughly and got code working.
    * Tejas did all the work. I was pretty much shadowing him, but very useful.

- Towards late evening, QA onboarded MU for us to test. But MU failed due to
  client-cert-fetch issue. Blocked on it.

- I triaged and sent a patch to Krupal Joshi to review.


2019, Dec 3 (Tue)
- Had to leave work early to take care of kids.

- Tested, with QA's help. Ran into Deployment Manager issues (which Simranjit
  fixed).
- IT/CSP issues prevented bringing up gateway in QA environment. This was
  resolved late in the day.
- Madhava found that NAT policies and egress_ip_list are getting deleted on
  removing an edge location. But not R53 entries and Forwarding Rules.


2019, Dec 2 (Mon)

- Examined prior commit in to logger.py file. I don't like output. It's no
  longer giving file names (just logger.py). It must be changed.
- CL 938273 is responsible for the change.

- Solving CYR-9674 (Use public_ip_pool of latest compute that edge belongs to).

- Meeting with Simranjit and he took CYR-9674 and I'll work on CYR-9686
    * Was a brutal talk/assessment of my work. Not sure what to do. It was
      complete incompetence on my part.
    * He was clearly upset that we did not test MU.
    * I blanked out or something and missed testing MU side of things.

- QA found build issues at night and I tried to help. But no progress.

#deployment #production #release #propertytax
- Madhavi and kids are not happy with staying late at work
- But tried to make up for it, somehow, by helping Madhavi with Kitchen cleaning
  etc.
- Paid property tax for entire year(2019-2020). From July 1, 2019 to June 30,
  2020.


- Deployment rollout to internal customers.
- Various tests passed.
- Stayed till 12/midnight at work, doing production release. Quite inefficient
  approach.
- Traffic loss still exists after modifying Step Function (my HA failover code).
- Analysis revealed two issues:
[1] * ha_state is updated in DB _independent_ of commitAll
    * If commitAll happens AFTER ha_state update, all sessions will not be in
      sync
    * Due to that ipsec-sa, tunnels etc are not present in Passive FW.
    * When Forwarding Rules are migrated to Passive FW, there will be traffic
      loss till all sessions are in sync

[2] * Some intricate differences between cold session sync and hot session sync.
    * This has effect on ipsec key exchanges and hence tunnel establishment.
    * Mingfei from Shu Lin's team says it's known issue and we must work around
      it.

- Proposed solution, at end of long debugging session is:
    * Increase "WaitSessionSyn" time from 180s to 420s
    * Make above change only for PwC and keep it 300s for others

- In check_ha_sync output of SQL queries ha_state of VMs were criss-crossing.
  So, HA sync test was failing.
- While testing trigger_ha_failover, I accidentally put Passive FW in suspend
  state. Recovered it and continued testing. Finally, this is working.
- Created new step function and changed worker.py to call it.
- *Some* bug in new step function. Especially verification of HA failover.

- First Telugu class at Chinmaya Mission. Hope something big happens from here.
- Divya's (neighbor) parents visited briefly.
- Akshay's friend, Ranvit's birthday. Madhavi took him there. House is in South
  San Jose.
- Swimming with coach Aaron for Akshay after birthday party.
- Madhavi went for Marma at Chitra's house at night 8pm and came at 11pm.
- Facial at night. Madhavi needed rest after Marma, but I was selfish.


2019, Oct 18 (Fri)
- Got super mad at Madhavi for kids being late. We stayed till 9am

- Meeting with Nilesh to understand how HA works between FWs. Key take aways:
    * FWs in AWS, vmid remains same as image upgrade can be done on it.
    * FWs in GCP, vmid is diff as new instance must be spun up.
- More notes:
    * saas_agent in each FW get it's network config from instance_master.
    * SA commits that config in its FW.
    * HA daemon (has some name), knows it's peer FW and establishes HA
      (active-passive pair) using some algo.
    * During upgrade of AWS FW, "in place" upgrade happens. saas_agent will
      update instance_master with it's network config.
    * This triggers following workflow:
        1. a procedure or trigger
        2. which invokes a lambda
        3. that causes network config update written to SQS
        4. An SNS to Active FW
        5. Which is committed locally
        6. HA daemon uses this to send heartbeats to new Passive FW
- Next Steps:
    * Understand if there are any stored procedures on instance_master table.
      See if it's related to my understanding above.
    * This is more or less confirmed. mysql_trigger_to_sns.py

#smartgrowth #pranavpatel #shwetal #anya
- Purchased Smart Growth's Developer Academy course for $1500. I better justify
  this.
- Reached home 6:15pm, Sadhana. Pranav Patel and family stopped by briefly. Nice
  to meet them all.

- Read other threads in Orchestrator:
    * main.py
    * Bringup, Orchestration
- Started looking in to RN/SC upgrade step functions. Specifically:
    * fw_upgrade - step function
    * Makes use of following lambda:
        - soft_upgrade_fw_action -> upgrade.py -> soft_upgrade/fw_action.py
        - soft_upgrade_fw_verify -> upgrade.py -> soft_upgrade/fw_verify.py
- I'm figuring out *how* step functions upgrade RN/SC. All details are not
  clear, but working through.
- Meeting with Xingsi Zhong to understand Step Functions and what they do during
  upgrade. He documented heavily the workflow of Step Functions.



2019, Oct 16 (Wed)
#REI #facial #smartgrowth #chrisporto
- Lot of reading online. Created a new group for IK Grads (ikgrads@groups.io).
  Intend to invite following people:
    * Ligeo, Madhulika, Vinit Mittal, Madhavi G, Sashi U, Suryam V
- Attended REI meetup (Chris Porto of Smart Growth)
- Went home late at 10pm
- Facial at night.

- RN/SC Upgrade script got postponed from 1.5.0 release. Perhaps 1.6.0 early
  drop. But continue working and deliver high quality code.
- Understanding implementation function in details - Fine combing through the
  code.
    * orchestrator.py does only stage1 and stage2
    * bringup.py does stage3, 4 & 5


2019, Oct 15 (Tue)
- Job referrals from Whatsapp (IITG Alumni) and some minor chores.


- Meeting with Rushin about RN/SC upgrade scripts and his requirements.
  Understood following requirements from him:
    * custids and blacklist_custids
    * active, passive arguments needed
- Mostly coding on RN/SC the whole day. Crux of the implementation is in:
    * pinned_gp_gateway_instance_upgrade_orchestration_impl
- Stayed till 9:30pm at work to get things done. But as I realized,
  understanding above function is key to FS or this project.


2019, Oct 14 (Mon)

  to lift it up quite a bit. Few key things for me:
    * Don't wait for guideance from anyone. Especially Prabhakar. Take charge of
      your features and make progress.
    * Have unit tests and code quality as highest priority in your development.
      Do not deliver features without unit tests.


2019, Oct 7 (Mon)

#asti #harrypotter #swimming #vim
- Dropped kids at school and at work by 9am
- Kids watched Harry Potter in evening. Akshay got scared.
- Swimming in evening. Got cold. Coach left early :(
- Asti stayed with us for one night, while she's helping out with Sahaj Samadhi

- Ramping up on Orchestrator arch, all things under lib/models. Understanding
  following:
    * Cust Node Model
    * Instance Model
    * Cust Model
    * Orchjobs
- They seem to be data layer to interact with RDS
- Was not feeling great. Left work around 4:30pm to pick kids.

- Spent time customizing Vim, especially cscope output colors. Spent > 1 hour.
  Seems waste of time, but I hope it has long term benefits.
Discussion Omplete. Checked with Tejas Patel. This should be doable.
- I did not give up on Vim colorschemes and continued experimenting. Finally
  settled on 'desert' scheme as it is solving my Cscope problem. Sigh! Relief!
- Back to FS on RN Upgarde.



2019, Sep 26 (Thu)
- Guruji's knowledge:
    * Balance between Spontaneity and Planning.
        - Too much Spontaneity leads to vagabond nature. Can't acheive much.
        - Too much Planning leads to inaction, or anger if something goes
          against the plan.
    * To achieve anything, following are required:
        - Effort, Energy, Skill, Providence/Luck, Willingness to Work for it
        - Energy, Skill and Providence/Luck can be increased by Meditation
    * How to correct wrong decision
        - Weigh pros and cons and the cost of trying to correct it.
- Ported bookmarks from Chrome in to Firefox.

- Wrote a rough FS draft and sent to Tejas and Prabhakar. Continue working on
  it, improving and refining.
- Discussed with Tejas about my FS. There will be orchestration-stage,
  cloud-formation-stage, bringup-stage.
- There will NOT be instance-transition-stage and deletion-stage.
- DIT-4269. Pyauth error, which is *not* real error. It passes and
  authenticates the cert presented.

#WFH #closet #REI
- Closet guys are here. I WFH
- Spoke to Quicken Loans guys. Gave me following rate for 15-year refi

      closing costs in the PITI
- We must focus on reducing Home Insurance. It's $1751/year (almost $150/month)

- Started looking in to bringup.py and orchestrator.py to understand the flow.
  This will help me write FS.
- Stayed up to 10pm at in office, working on FS.
- There was Adelphi pyauth issue. Tried to help them out, like a war room. Spent

2019, Sep 24 (Tue)
#WFH #NOTWFH #closet #flyhomes
- Closet installation.
- Updated Anki with IK problems (Ad-Hoc section)
- Webinar from Flyhomes. They have 3 options

    * Guaranteed buy. If, we as a buyer, fail to secure loan after FH buys from
      Seller, FH will Guarantee they'll keep the home on their name.
    * Some kind of Swap program, where you are upgrading your home while
      planning to sell your current home.
- I left for work as installers did not come. Trevor texted there was
  miscommunication and installers will come on Wednesday.

- Up around 4am working on Func Spec for RN/SC upgrade.
- Examining mysql tables: cust_topology. I want to look if any triggers are set
  on cust_topology table on instance1_transient column
- I'm seeing if write to this column triggers anything in Orchestrator.
- Got a Knowledge Transfer from Tejas Patel on Upgrade code. He says it helps to
  understand code flow to write up FS.
- Frank Ye is driving merge from budapest-saas to kiev-saas. Very painful
  process. He asked us to merge our changes.
- Once merge is done, I switched back to understanding GP upgrade code.

#offday #schooloff #WFH #vim
- Aarushi visited doctor and everything is looking fine
- But Aarushi took off from school for rest. Madhavi WFH.
- Left home around 5pm to pick Akshay. Sadhana, dinner, closet cleaning and
  family time.


- Built Vim in local Mac OS with cscope, python and python3 enabled.
- Working on CYR-8536, botocore race condition issue.
- On Friday, before leaving home, I used traceback.print_exc() to get stack
  trace for boto3 failure. That was not working today. Took time to make it
  work.
- I used logger.error("error traceback: %s", str(traceback.format_exc())). I
  don't know why this worked and not print_exc()
- I now have botocore exception/stack trace
- Very strange behavior. I had to restart Macbook to fix a bug in Messages app.
  It was not delivering messages. SSH connections got reset. Now, I no longer
  see the above stack trace. This is driving me crazy.

- My strategy now (12:30pm) is to catch NoCredentialException and retry invoke
  or other mechanism. Try to reach end goal instead of wandering around.
- Put in retry mechanism where db_client will again invoke
  boto3.Session().client('lambda', 'us-west-2'). Let's see if it works.

- Provided above solution. Tested and it's working. I found another issue with
  same 'Unable to locate credentials' but that's on Krupal. Can't work anymore
  on this
- Emailed the team with observations and updated ticket with findings.

- Reading Tejas Patel's documentation on Supporting many Edge locations to 1
  compute location for GPCS MU.

    * Opposite values are complimentary
    * Accept people and situations as they are
    * Do not see intentions behind other's mistakes
    * Present moment is inevitable:

  longer watch it.
- Almost pulled an all nighter.
- Almost did a facial in morning.

- Working on FS for Upgrade. Reading up on scheduler.py file
- Discussions with Prabhakar. Decided to do following
    * Write FS on separate VPC for dbaccess and propose for DevOps and all
    * Write FS for 1.5.0 upgrade
    * Explained that there's lot of value in making dbaccess as EC2 instance or
      containerize it. Deeper discussions required.
    * Followup on Resiliency project (PoC or something) is required after above
      two.



2019, Sep 17 (Tue)
- Handed off DIT-4117 to other team after triaging the issue.

    * Create two more subnets with NAT in them so they can talk to "outside"
      world.
    * Have routes from private subnet to subnet with NAT and connection to
      Internet GW.

- Look in to new regions bring up in Orchestrator. Specifically, Osaka and
  Belgium.
- Asked Prabhakar for bigger project. Got assigned to do release upgrade of
  1.5.0

    * EM's constant reference to Neuralink and constant "world is about to doom"

  Prabhakar etc: DIT-3725 and DIT-3726



2019, Aug 7 (Wed)
#work #nightwork #timewaste
- We woke up around 7am, which is much  better than 8am :). Madhavi took kids to
  school.

- Started Cloud Map PoC. Plan is following.
    * Have an API endpoint in dev3. Call it "helloworld". No authentication, but
      just returns "Hello World from region - XX"
    * Have "API Handler" lambda that handles calls to above API.
    * Have "helloworld_lambda" in two regions that just returns "Hello World
      from region - XX"
    * Register both lambda ARN with Cloud Map
    * "API Handler" will query Cloud Map for which ARN to query. Cloud Map will
      return the ARN that's used in talking to that handler.
    * Abandoned this idea due to drawbacks in many ways.
- Set up API GW endpoint called "helloworld" handled by a lambda: 'api_handler'.
  Now it just return "Hello from Lambda" string.

- Setup meeting with Team for Thursday afternoon for initial project proposal.

- Kept updating Wiki with research material. Mostly did cost analysis for
  multi-region solution recommended by AWS.
- Slightly intense meeting with Prabhakar that I should only focus on Resiliency
  project and not on other stuff.
    * I feel he did not fully understand what I was doing or it's benefits.
    * Either ways, I need to manage things better. Do stuff under-the-radar and
      with much less damage (my changes were making FW go maint-mode)

- Left early (4:30pm) to pick up kids. Take care of them etc.
- Came back to work after dinner. Next time, should do WFH at night. Mainly,
  don't waste time watching Youtube stuff.



2019, Aug 6 (Tue)
#timewaste
- At work by 10:30am, slightly better than earlier days.

- Edge-Optimized API vs Regional API
    * Edge-Optimized = CloudFront POPs will have host names. So, nearest POP
      responds to API request. API GW is still in Oregon
    * Regional = Serves API requests originating in those regions only. External
      API requests bypasses CloudFront.

- Meeting with Manager. Try HA for Lambda only and not entire pipeline.
- Watched "AWS Cloud Map" re:Invent video. Good solution to our "HA for Lambda"
  problem.

- Picked kids, cooked dinner, sadhana, family time

- Watched Youtube videos on cricket - time wasted.

- AWS Cloud Map PoC


2019, Aug 5 (Mon)
- Worked with Prabhakar to close/transfer CYR-7673 bug to Shu Lin's team.
    * This FW is a TM Hub (Ticketmaster Hub)
    * Around the time with CommitAll failure happened, I saw an error that says
      "Cannot subscribe to SNS topic"
    * This error was found after a 'commit' was attempted.
    * Prabhakar said Shu Lin's team must look in to this.

- Investigated various options for Resiliency work. Updated wiki with findings.
  Updated Prabhakar with details
- Some drawings to illustrate high level design. Investigate open items.


- Studied Spanish and downloaded Chinese flash cards
- Worked on vim-talk. Spacevim seems very good option. They have example to run
  a docker image

- At night, read links from Pocket library: Geo/S2 library, Dynamic Prog
  articles by Avik Das

Weekly Summary
---------------
Good:
---
Exercised 2-3 times this week. Stayed at work to support whatever I could with
rollout, although I was not needed.

Looked at Hugo static website builder. Looking good, but it also diluted my
focus.

Bad:
---
I did 2-3 facials this week (or past 10 days). Have a bit more self-control.
It's bringing down the prana and we are so tired, ending up sleeping a lot.

Neelam Madaik asked for help with ART Excel. I committed, but did not do
anything. Please don't repeat this.

I also lost focus on Vim talk/presentation work. I moved on to updating my
website with new Hugo theme. Explored how Hugo works and all that. Stay
focused and committed and get it done.

2019, Aug 1 (Thu)
#swimming
- Debugged CYR-7927, commitAll failure.
    * kms_decrypt() method failed to install server cert and TLS profile. This
      is due to Access issue
    * saas-agent plugin did not have access to get master_key to decrypt server
      certificate saved in MySQL DB.
    * Due to this, perform_commit() failed later, thus commitAll.
    * All these errors are in saas_agent.log
    * With Thirumal's help, closed the bug. It's no longer seen in latest
      saas_agent.
- Resiliency project. Read few articles. At night, I found a good solution
  (multi-region deployment)

- Swimming coach in evening.

#work
- Kids stayed home as Akshay was not feeling well. Madhavi WFH.
- Left for home around 4:30pm. Did Sadhana with Madhavi, dinner and back to work
  around 7:30pm
- Team is doing production rollout.

- Found that pycrypto package was missing in kiev-saas builds. Merged that
  change and trying to load it to Frank Ye's VM.
    * This messed up stuff as I merged tonnes of other stuff in to core_rpms.py.
      I should **double** check before submitting changes
    * Reverted/Rolledback my changes and made _individual_ change for pycrypto
      package.
    * Pycrypto still failed/not-downloaded. Spoke to Sean Wang from engtools
      team. He pointed out few errors in core_rpms.py file and that worked.

- Merging specific directores from budapest-saas to main to kiev-saas. A bit
  tedious process. We do not want to do wholesale merge.
    * So, we merge specific directories, make a kiev-saas build and see if
      that's enough and working. Else find missing dir and repeat.

  applying DNS resolver patch

- Spoke to Thaiviet from PanOS team who debugged 7092 issue
    - Issue is with super_custid being updated every time lcaas-cert-fetch
      fails. He says mgmtsrvr will automatically retry without sleep.
    - The 4s then, is in fact processing time - generate CSR, privkey and all
      that
    - Prabhakar seem to know, within saas-agent code, where super_custid is
      getting overwritten again and again.
- Suggestion to update client-cert-fetch code to _NOT_ write anything to file if
  fetch fails. Done. Committed and merged to devel branch

#birthday #marma #massage #tire #costco
- Madhavi took day off, with Marma to Sriparna Sen in morning, followed by Thai
  Massage in afternoon.
- Her car tire had issues, so we got it replaced in Costco that evening.
- We got a cake from Safeway in evening.
- Madhavi was a bit depressed.
- I tested and merged saas_agent integration code. FINALLY.
- Continue testing stuff and fixing bugs/issues.

2019, May 14 (Tue)
- saas agent integration work:
    * Again I switched to getting Crypto package in to repo. Tejas Patel tried
      to help, but did not make much progress.
    * I switched again to RPMS and taking help from Hilay. Feel it's right way
      to do things.
    * Started the build by checking in changes to core_rpms.py file. But it
      failed again.
    * Hilay debugged the issue closely and found that pycrypto package in FW is
      compiled for gmp package version 4.3.1
    * However, gmp package itself is upgraded to version 6.0.0. So, we have to
      rebuild pycrypto package for gmp-6.0.0
    * For this, I have to checkout out OSS tree in which pycrypto exists and
      compile the whole thing.
    * I requested access to that tree from ENGTOOLS team
- Headed home, and family time.


2019, May 13 (Mon)
- saas agent integration work. Quite dragging. Packaging is taking too much
  time.
    * Trying lots of things around that.
    * Prabhakar's changes to core_rpms.py file to include pycrypto package was
      throwing dependency errors
    * Hillay suggested ways to debug it. But we moved on to next idea.
    * We decided to add Crypto package (entire source directory) as part
      budapest-saas repo. Crazy thought, but trying.
    * There's build issues around including Crypto package in source.
    * Briefly, I tried cyptography package, but having old version on FW killed
      this idea.

- Guruji's birthday, but couldn't do much. Just sadhana.

#latenight #work #facial
- Two days, I stayed till 9:30pm at office and worked on saas_agent integration
- Lot of challenges along the way.
    * All environments had to be deleted and recreated by SRE. Lost a day or
      less on that.
    * Tested saas_agent integration on AWS first. It started failing because DNS
      was not resolving. Figured out with Nilesh, finally.
    * Moved all code/testing to FW on GCP. It's a challenge to migrate stuff,
      but I found a quicker way.
    * Finding how to SCP in GCP FW's took time, but now it's common knowledge.
    * restarts of various daemons are causing FW to go in to maintenance mode.
    * Late on Thursday, I realized that CCF functionality must be in
      pan_saas_agent_loader. Which is totally different view than I had earlier.
    * Coding and testing took additional two hours, luckily, and not more.
    * Merged "some" of my changes in to devel/budapest-saas branch
- Some discussions/meetings with center architect/Shalini. We will be submitting
  proposals to City this week
- Kids birthday partie (Hemasundar's son, Darsh). Took kids to it.
- Took a day to organize my code (ready for commit).
- Mother's day celebrations at Akshay and Aarushi's classes.
- Small projects for Aarushi and Akshay. Mainly mother's day related work.
- Teachers appreciation week. Madhavi purchased something for teachers from
  Target.
- Facial on Friday night.

#work
- Came to office around 10:30 to work on pending issues (saas_agent + CCF)
- Got root access to VMs on GCP. Put in various debugging messages and trying
  out stuff.
    * changed debug_status = True. The it prints bunch of stuff to stdout that
      mgmtsrvr is not expecting. It's erroring out at wrong place.
    * Above debug is making us focus in wrong area.
    * Modified add_message function to print additional debugs

#dinner #vivek #ty #sfo
- Anniversary dinner in SFO with family + Vivek + Ty
- Made progress in XML parsing errors in client cert fetch code in saas agent.
    * Client API was returning certificate with quotes and XML parser was unable
      to decode/parse it. Removing double quotes solved the problem.
    * But to that string, there's dbaccess result is appended. Which is throwing
      XML parse error again. Debugging it.
- Later in evening, QA team found that lcaas-cert-fetch job is failing (never
  worked to being with) from GCP FW.


2019, May 2 (Thu)
- Read an article about some engineers at Youtube placing "IE6 will soon be
  deprecated" banners on webpage without permission.
- Debugging/Integration session with Simranjit on masterkey clientlib API.
  Identified some issues. Fix and commit. Two action items:
    * Identify locations on FW where ca.crt, lcaas.pem and privkey.pm files are
      present
    * Run masterkey API on FW. There's a OSRNG error from Crypto.Random module
      on FW. Fix it.



2019, May 1 (Wed)
- GCP Weekly meeting
- Meeting with Simranjit on "Master Key" related work. I have to provide an API
  to decrypt "master key" data. Some related work.
- Merged CCF lambda changes from main to devel. Krupal pointed the diffs and
  changes that were not merged from main to devel. Manually did that.
- Started building REST API "pipeline" for Master Key feature/work. This took
  most of the day and I couldn't work on saas_agent integration.
- Committed this code at end of the day
- At night, did little bit of triaging on 6813 bug (CCF failing again on QA
  environment)

#coffee #depressed
- Took me a while to figure out the source of client_cert_fetch call. By end of
  the day, it's clear.
- Did sadhana at work and stayed a bit late to finish up property appraisal
  assessments, emails to center architect etc
- Drank coffee in afternoon and couldn't sleep at night. Also feeling pretty
  depressed. AVOID COFFEE
- Started working on Client Cert Fetch integration late at night. Completed
  following:
    * integrate client_cert_fetch API on GCP, but leave everything same if AWS
    * after fetching client certificate, update DB table: instance_pki. This
      needs cert and private key. This is tricky and blocked here.


2019, Apr 29 (Mon)
- dbaccess params/arguments/sql/start etc keywords stuff
    * dbaccess is failing and figuring out why. Getting 500 Internal Server
      error
    * pyauth2 (I changed it to pyauth2) is failing with following error

(88c74d57-6aad-11e9-8d9e-1f811224b7f1) Execution failed due to configuration error: Authorizer function failed with response body:
{
    "errorMessage": "RequestId: f8579fbd-738a-4a70-9667-87aa97c58b7f Process exited before completing request"
}
    * Changing Authorizer back to pyauth helped. The client cert is "revoked".
      When I tried fetching "new" cert, that failed too: SSL errors

- Explained stuff to Madhava about potential changes coming to API

- client_cert_fetch had an issue (coding). Fixed that code in lambda function.
- After above change, dbaccess has started working. OMG!!!!! The root cause was
  in these:
    * client certificate had problem. dbaccess failed: pyauth2 did not indicate
      properly the reason - WHY???
    * Getting new client certificate hit roadblock because CCF lambda had a bug
    * I understood things, tested and explained to Madhava.

- Integrate CCF in to saas_agent code
    * FW went down/terminated. Migrated all my work to new FW in N California
      region
    * Goal is to integrate CCF code with lcaas-cert-fetch script, somewhere in
      /usr/local/bin

2019, Apr 26 (Fri)
- Took care of paperwork for Garage repair. Signed contract, wrote a check and
  mailed it to Silicon Valley Builders Group (SVBG)

- Standup on GCP
- Integrated client cert fetch code from Prabhakar in to saas_agent. Found an
  issue in client cert fetch path.
    * If CSP throws an error in fetch, abort msgbus registration process. This
      is not happening today. Fixed this issue, but not committed.
- CSP server is down (or some fault). So, client cert fetch is failing.
- I validated that saas_agent is getting installed after downloading. Following
  verifications are done
    * DB is updated with installed version
    * cfg.saas.installed_saas_agent_version is updated
    * images folder has correct RPM package downloaded
    * FIPS process is failing. WHY?
    * 'show jobs all' does not show commitAll status. WHY?
- I'm disabling FIPS and verifying if commitAll goes through. Did not work.



2019, Apr 25 (Thu)
#GCP
- Continue testing on new FW in Ohio region. Get dbaccess and saas_agent_loader
  working
- Kids came to work/office. It was really bad. Hard to focus. They were
  fighting, asking me to get stuff, what not. Lost some time.
- Dropped kids off at home during lunch break.

- After moving all my code to new FW. dbaccess stopped working. An issue in
  _get_certs() method I wrote was not returning a dict.

- After dbaccess started workign, s3_download failed. Triaging that, I faced
  following issues:
    * tracing logs were difficult because I was using 'tail -f saas_agent.log |
      grep <stuff>'. This was not working. Just grep works.
    * Logging was at INFO level. Changed to DEBUG and more logs are visible now.
    * First updated 'target_saas_agent_version' in instance_master table to
      1.4.0-300. But that was not working. WHY?
    * Above target_version must have a package in saas_agent_mappings table.
      This means, there's a package in S3 bucket for this version.
    * There was no version in mappings table. So, I found a version that has a
      package and started testing.
    * But that again failed because my clientlib API takes *only* the version
      and not full s3 path. Clientlib builds the full path.
    * I fixed that issue in Clientlib: a) API b) Lambda. Lot of document changes
      and QA automation updates are required now.
    * I tried to test from Chlorine above changes to Clientlib
      saas_agent_loader (s3_path instead of saas version)
    * Finally, saas_agent is getting downloaded in to local images folder

- Stayed back at work, instead of going to FlyHomes talk in San Mateo. Did
  Sadhana at work and dinner and continued working in to night.
- Got things working at 10:30pm and reached home at 11pm

- Spent time with Madhavi, and then did monthly budgeting on Excel. Slept at 2am
  or so, due to Coffee consumption.


2019, Apr 24 (Wed)
#GCP #exercise
- Weekly GCP meeting. Couldn't deliver saas_agent_loader/integration :(
    WHY?
- Trying to test saas_agent_loader. Must make changes to MySQL table, but found
  that my FW is missing in intance_master table.??? WTF
- FW/Instance does not have entry in instance_master. So, I cannot make
  saas_agent to download new/another version.
- So, I decided to insert an entry in to instance_master. But that's failing
  with "--read-only" flag. Aparently MySQL server is started with this flag.
- I'll check with Tejas Patel or someone on making this work.

- After lunch+meditation, debugged an issue with Krupal Joshi where msgbus
  registration was failing from within client_cert_fetch call.
- Turned out API endpoint was incorrect :(

- Tejas recommendation is to use new FW. I have switched to FW in Ohio region.

- Did 1 hour walk in Gym. Good.


2019, Apr 23 (Tue)
- Working with Madhava on automating Clientlib automation scripts. Ran into few
  issues (6750 and 6751). IoT errors during client_cert_fetch.
- Had a meeting with Samarpit to understand issues seen over weekend.
- Madhava still facing IoT failure issues. Krupal is fixing.
- I worked on saas_agent loader code, integrating dbaccess and saas_agent_loader
  APIs in to saas_agent
    * Made progress on integrating dbaccess.
    * Made progress on integrating saas_agent_download
- Meditation in afternoon
- Spoke to Gil for garage door quote. He's going to send me by evening.
- Texted Kristopher from Farmers Insurance with questions (about payment)
- Watched a PyCon video by Ned Batchelder
- Printouts of Madhavi + Akshay picture for Mother's day



2019, Apr 22 (Mon)
- GCP standup. Fix client libs to bring up saas-agent on GCP/AWS FW. Worked with
  PM.
- Figured out reasons when dbaccess endpoints are failing when provided with
  valid certs.
    * There's a CRL check happening that downloads 12MB file and validates if
      the cert is revoked or not. That's timing out.
    * Instead, use OSCP. A ticket was opened by Prabhakar and assigned to me to
      do this work
- Found out that something is messed up in GPGW instance on dev3. So, we spun up
  new FW and started working on it. Continued debugging in night.
- Looks like the results obtained from dbaccess is not presented to caller in
  correct dictionary form.

#lunch #nodejs
- Team lunch
- Total debugging of echo_test. I hard coded epoch_time and nouce values.
  Compare following values in Python and NodeJS code/output:
    - SSLCERT << OK
    - CLIENTCERT << Fixed an issue here
    - Privkey: << Fixed an issue here
    - signature << After fixing above, this is OK
    - payload_signature << Finally, this is also same. So, all fields are same,
      so far

- There's an OCSP validation, which I'm ignoring
- Create signed token as follows
    - epoch = int(time.time())
        - If this file present:
            - /opt/pancfg/mgmt/plugins/appdata/cloud_services/etc/delta_time
            - use it to adjust epoch (epoch += delta)
        - I'll ignore delta_time for now

    - nouce = ''.join(random.choice(string.ascii_uppercase + string.digits) for
      _ in range(16))
    - cert = clientcert // find out what is the format of this??
    - signature = get_header_signature(epoch, nouce) //
    - payloadsig = get_payload_signature()

- Finally, after resolving all issues, it started working. echo_test in NodeJS
  is working. Pretty happy.



2019, Jan 24 (Thu)

- Wrote to Shruti Shrivastava, Jyothika Banerjee for UI/UX roles in my team.

  within PANW network. I think the ACLs are created such way.

  gave us 30 days
- Wrote an email summarizing the discussion/meeting minutes. Jon Miller is our
  contact.

- Start working on GCP CF. Looked at few sample code to upload files to Cloud
  Storage and get those files from them.

- Watched NodeJS Udemy video for 30-45 mins. Learnt few concepts:
    * let & const
    * Arrow functions
    * Arrays, Objects & References
    * Spread and Rest operators
    * Object Destructuring
    * Async, Await & Promises
    * Terminal Strings <- simple stuff

- Madhavi started AOS course at center. Taking care of kids etc.


2019, Jan 17 (Thu)
#crypto
- Meeting with Prabhakar. Do _not_ use Python and get PoC working ASAP. Man, it's
  hard, especially with kids, learning new language (NodeJS) and stuff. I'm
  somehow slow in getting stuff done. Not for the lack of effort. But ...
- With Madhavi gone this weekend, I need so much more time.

- Watched NodeJS videos on Youtube to learn the stuff. Watched an 1 hour long
  video.

- Dropped out of Crypto course on Coursera. Not the right time to do this stuff.
- Trying lot of things to get basic curl stuff working on GCP.
- It finally did. I just did not look at right place. It's in function emulator
  logs

- Stayed up late at night and got it to work on GCP console. Quite happy.


2019, Jan 16 (Wed)
- More investigation of echo_test.py script and unpacked all that's happening. A
  bit more clarity on what to do.
- I think we can do PoC using Python.

#sankranti #bhogi #enema #sick #WFH
- Fasting, due to Sankranti/Bhogi.
- Dropped Akshay a bit late and reached work at 10:30am
- Investigating 5623 (GCP CF). Meetings with Prabhakar
- I wrote up todo tasks and Prabhakar made some changes. I now have to check how
  to connect to AWS API GW using cert based authentication.
- Use 'echo test' code/script in Panorama CLI

- Started reading about CSR, OSCP and few terminologies

- A bit more progress on 5623, GCP->AWS calls. Lot of investigative work.

- Aarushi is still sick, so stayed home. Madhavi WFH.
- Did Enema to Aarushi and that helped a LOT. She's fully recovered after that.


2019, Jan 14 (Mon)
#WFH #sick #bhogi
- Aarushi got sick and threw up in morning. I WFH to take care of her.
- Later in afternoon, she threw up again. So, took her to hospital. Lots of

- ZOFRAN medicine (to avoid nausea) is prescribed.

- I came to work around 9pm to catch up on backlog. Madhavi is taking care of
  kids.

#eatout #restaurant #inchinsbamboogarden
- Continue on 5109 external APIs.
    * CLI changes in XML files are done. They are calling a backend API
      (getRegionDetails). But I think that API is not getting invoked.
    * This is where I'm stuck/investigating at mid-day
    * Now, I found an API that gets called from GUI code
        + cloud_services.Fwaas.completeLicenseTypes << Bandwidth
        + cloud_services.Fwaas.completeIpsecTunnels << Ipsec Tunnels list
        + cloud_services.Fwaas.completeLicenseTypes << regions
    * Finally figured out how to do this feature/story. Left the day with some
      unfinished bugs.

- Dinner at Inchin's Bamboo Garden




2019, Jan 10 (Thu)
#1:1
- Continue working on 5109 APIs via CLI/Backend, after Prabhakar suggested so.
- Made good progress in code changes, how to build etc. But did not finish the
  job.
- Madhavi has IK. So, kids care, cooking, sadhana etc.

  codereview (and committed to main branch).

2019, Jan 8 (Tue)
#AOL #skiplevel
- At the center to meet Architect and General Contractor. Lots of discussions on
  Tenant Improvements. Costs are ballooning.

- Skip level meeting with Deven Raut in Cafe. A bit of wake up call. He said
  that I was a "forceful" hire. Guruji probably forced it :). I need to deliver.

- Continue working on 5728 bug (remove a column in DB table: orch_cfg).
    * I looked at all places where this is used. I do not see a reason to have
      this info in the DB table. Mostly this column can be deleted.
    * Need to create an 'ALTER table' SQL command for 1.3.1 release and test
      this out. Will confirm with Tejas Patel.
    * Spoke to Simranjit C about NOT entering dbpassword info in to orch_cfg
      table.

- How should the API look like? What is the expectation from the API?  Is there
  an existing API that I can model this around?
    * Siva pointed out how APIs look in GUI. Trace following API call
        plugins/cloud_services/remote-networks/onboarding/entry[@name='test-4']/ipsec-tunnel
    * This returns bunch of IPsec tunnels to choose from backend. Very useful
      example.

- Left home around 6pm, sadhana and family time.


2019, Jan 7 (Mon)

Met Dan Comfort, PLM for AirWave product, over lunch. Very helpful. He shared
his ideas about AirWave product, push to Cloud, product challenges etc.

Bug scrub for Rahul's team. I personally worked on some code clean up, it's
tests etc. I couldn't work on 29137, which is much more important.

The code clean up stuff I did had build failure after generating code review.
Review was generated on very old code. Took quite some time to resolve
conflicts, rerun tests and new review etc.


PERSONAL
I don't know how the day passed. Most of it is gone in doctors visits. Madhavi
took Aarushi to dentist. I took Akshay to doctor for eye check up. We were
late, so, rescheduled to later in the day. Went to work by 11am and left work

Interviewed a senior candidate for Shreeni's team.

Spoke with Umesh Patil from Cloud team on progress. It will still take 2 weeks
more. A bit demotivated, but will wait and see. Spoke with Jisheng Wang from
Niara team about opportunities in Niara. My conclusion is that it's not really
a security company, but rather analytics company looking for security issues.
They use AI/ML and Big Data as tools to this end.

Meanwhile, my current director, Rami Rivlin, wants update on my move to Cloud

LK and Kids swimming and Chanting class. Worked on C3 final during chanting

Also watched the movie (Newton). It is quite good.


2018, Jan 26 (Fri)

Worked on two TCAM issues:
    * Code clean up (COPP groups clean up) and started few HT runs
    * CR 29137. I expect multiple entries in TCAM for each Egress ACL. That's
      not happening.
I investigated 2nd issue for some time using GDB. I need more time.

PERSONAL
Attempted final exam of C3 and failed. Got 22/30. Failed few non-pictorial
questions on Gnutella, Chord and such esoteric protocols. I'll carefully look
at the questions and try again.

Came to work quite late (11am) since I dropped Akshay. Code clean up issue
failed Gate test. Debugged that. Feel like wasted some time at work.

PERSONAL
Emailed Sandeep Sukhija, met at REI meetup, about working together.

Family ate out at restaurant (Chaat Bhavan). It's a good place. Mild spices,
not noisy music, variety of dishes, full vegetarian restaurant.

Spent couple of hours at work solving final exam (C3) quiz. Good learning
(refresh) of lectures I listed longed time ago. This final is taking quite
some time to complete.

After long delay (almost a month) I returned Sonic Net's router. I sometimes
struggle to get basic work done and this is an example. Telephone is missing
and don't know where it's gone.

#rei
WORK
Was planning to WFH, but last minute changes and I went to work. Madhavi has
to do "16 fruits nomu". Juggled quite a few issues throughout the day.
* MAX ACE's supported in Egress TCAM. How "small bank" and "single" field can
  be used
* Test various TCP options. Do they work on Topflite
* Follow up with engineers for +2 on code review of TCP cleanup (Tunnel
  Counters)
* Explored FastLog implementation in sFlow (just read the wiki). This is just
  a beginning. Need to read a lot more and quickly implement. I see lot of
  benefits using this framework.

Lot of time spent in testing options to tweak TCAM group size. TD2+ has
limited ways to do it (using bcmFieldGroupModeXXX enum values). Resort to
default, for now. I plan to clean up code in this area.

PERSONAL
Attended the REI meetup. Met a person (Sandeep Sukhija) with whom I can
potentially work and learn stuff. Emailed him following day.

Very surprised/upset with myself. Not much happened since morning and am not
sure how the time got lost. Worked on 29169 bug and closed it. Rearranging the
group priorities may have fixed the issue.

Up around 3am and worked on C3 course. Progress is very slow, as I forgot lot
of material. Refreshed Lamports Timestamps, Vector Timestamps, P2P protocols

I slept in late and couldn't got to LK. Took kids to swimming and chanting
class. Madhavi went to center to do Marma at 5pm and back at 7pm.

I got an hour or so during chanting class to work on cloud computing final
exam. I forgot a lot of things taught in first couple of weeks. Snitches, YARN
details and all seems totally new to me. Reading my notes helped (instead of
watching videos again). I don't know how long I'll remember these things, if
not used regularly.

Interviewed in Cloud Engineering team with Minimol Thomas and Priyank. I think
it went well. I hope the team felt the same.

Worked on TCAM issues (29220) where I ported Ridley's TCAM changes to
Topflite. There's an issue in TF where "TCP Established" flag is changed to
two rules, but the stat object is only for one rule. This needs to be fixed
(in TF).

#YES
SEVA
[Tue 16, 10:17] MLK weekend for Madhavi and Me. So, holiday, but not for kids.
Dropped Kids in school and did YES course. There was parent/teacher meeting at
the end. Overall YES was very useful for me, as I have been out of teaching in
a while. I must announce more YES programs (Spring break) with other teachers.
Working in team is best for me.

PERSONAL
[Tue 16, 10:26] Madhavi went to give/get marma to Chitra's house. I worked on
Cloud Computing Quiz for week 5 and FINALLY passed. Topics were Global
Snapshots, Multicast Ordering (FIFO, Causal etc) and Virtual Synchrony. I
still do not have grip on these topics. Coursera allows multiple attempts. So,
I passed in 3rd (or was it 4th?) attempt. I would have certainly failed in
real classroom/University setting. I got 47% in first attempt. I'm not sure
how to do better.

One good thing about multiple attempts is that I got clarity on FIFO, Causal
ordering protocols. I'm still not sure how buffering works.

Kids care, Aarushi's dance class, dinner and all that.

Woke up around 6am. Cleaned up the kitched, freshen up, Sadhana, snacks
shopping for YES kids and off to YES program in Cupertino. Surprisingly 9 kids
showed up for YES.

After returning from YES, lunch and started on Cloud Computing course. Plan to
read forums for mistakes I did

SEVA
[Sat 13, 14:46] First day of YES course. 9 Kids in the program. Very happy to

WORK:
[Fri 12, 14:43] Tested 29097 (ttl not working) bug. It was reopened by QA.
However, I found it to be working. I spoke to her. There's a misunderstanding
on how ACL should work. Need clarification.

PERSONAL:
Watched Cloud Computing lectures and started working on Quiz. Questions were
intense and time consuming. But struggled through and failed in first attempt.
I'll look at the forums and retake on Saturday or Sunday.

Cleaned up the house a little bit and throwed trash (so kids don't bring stuff
back)

Started Sadhana at 5pm, before kids arrive.

Kids care (Pizza over Bread), some grocery shopping in Safeway. Routine stuff.
Little bit of preparation for YES course. Slept at 10pm. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.

2018, Jan 11 (Thu)
#bugs #TCAM

PERSONAL:
[Thu 11, 10:54] Slept at 10pm last night and woke up well rested, in morning by
6am. I intend to practice that daily (sleeping at 10pm). I wanted to WFH, but
WFH isn't making much sense when kids school is on. I have to bring kids back
home anyway (especially if Madhavi is also WFH). So, I decided against it.

Watched Cloud Computing videos on Paxos. Started the Quiz and found questions
on Chandy-Lamport, FIFO and Causal ordering. I'll watch the videos again and
attempt the Quiz after lunch.

Re-watched Chandy-Lamport algorithm for Global Snapshots.

I strongly plan on completing this course and getting certification.

SEVA:
Called up Priya about YES. So far, we have 3 people and one being transferred.
We need many more. I should do some outreach.


WORK:
Sent out bug scrub report and asked the team to pick up a bug if they haven't
already. Currently, bug count is at 37 and must be brought down to 25 very
soon. That's a personal goal.

One of my bug (23087) finally got merged. It's the one where CopyToCpuCancel
flag is set whenever drop action is configured and NO logging action is
present. In this bug, user configured a 'deny all' ACL rule and was surprised
to see OSPF Keep Alive packets still continuing between peers. That's because,
Keep Alive packets are 'CopyToCpu' packets and 'drop' action does NOT conflict
with it. With my change, they are no longer copied to CPU.

For bug 29118, peer reviewer asked me to run L3 stats FT tests, just to make
sure it doesn't break counter FTs. IMO, it shouldn't, but started HT run for
it.

Sent out some emails to halon-dev, one being about Google's Monolith repo and
how we can use some ideas for our own.

Some team members are in Roseville for technical discussions on DpD design.
House looks empty.

Got new bugs opened. I notified devs about it. Going forward, I must triage
the bug a little bit more before talking to the devs. That way, first level of
screening can be performed and reassigned if it's not in my team or needs more
info.





2018, Jan 10 (Wed)

[Thu 02, 10:35] TCAM issue of in-place update
[Thu 02, 12:19]
Notes on TCAM in-place update change
1) When a port is set/unset, set 'updated' field to true.
2) Remove 'tcam_hw_entry_match' API check in tcam_entry_new_tcam_hw_entry. This
check is, most likely, not needed on Topflite. Ports info is captured using port
bitmap in PI and passed to PD. If PD supports it (like T2+), it can be used. If
it's not (Dune), it will be split up in to one HW entry for each port.

If portmap is changed, I'm relying on 'updated' field in tcam_entry update
entries in-place. A lot of checks must be put as PD requirements in Topflite is
different.
    * 'updated' is set to true in various APIs
    * L4 properties that were examined in tcam_hw_entry_match API
        - src_port and dst_port

calls to static functions. Decided to rewrite my own API to check if an IPv6
address is within a subnet. I think it's a bit of a task.
