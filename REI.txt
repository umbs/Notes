==============   LESSONS    FROM     REI    PODCASTS     ===================

[1] Bigger Pockets
[2] Life Time Cash Flow (Rod Khlief)

===================   NOTES     FROM    =========================
======  CRUSHING IT IN APARTMENT AND COMMERCIAL RE   =============

Ch 4:
- Best investment property for small investor tend to be: multifamily (10-75
  units), multitenant retail, multitenant office and self-storage with strong
  cash flow.

- Small investors are better off choosing a market that avoids direct
  competition with big investors.

- Large investors look for Class A properties. Class C are sometimes
  overlooked and offer attractive opportunities.

Ch 5: Finding the right property

- Using Broker relationships
- Directly approaching property owners, using tax records etc
- Through contacts in property management companies
- Word of mouth from RE attorneys, accountants, lenders, contractors, fellow
  investors etc
- Auctions:
    * Risky to get financing (have to put lot of down payment)
    * Short window for closing
    * Use lot of caution

Ch 6: Analyzing properties
- NOI and cap rates give accurate picture on value of property
- Seller's Proforma's are _future_ potential and not _current_ income
- Always ask for following:
    * rent roll (actually, ask for bank deposits of the rent, which is even
      more accurate)
    * lease info (start and end dates)
    * Look at past 2-3 years income

- For commercial property, you may have following
    * Common Area Maintenance (CAM),
        + Parking lot maintenance
        + Snow removal
        + Landscaping
        + Utility bills (lighting, cooling etc)

- Expenses must be looked over a long period of time. Consider seasonal costs
  too.
    * Property Mgmt fees
    * Common utilities
    * Landscaping
    * Snow removal
    * Insurance
    * Property taxes
    * Repairs and maintenance
    * Legal fees
    * Advertising fees

#342, Kris Benson
Title: From Duplexes to a 64-Unit and Self-Storage Millions

Keywords:

Notes:
- "Big deals and small deals are same amount of work. Small deals make less
  amount of money"
- First commercial property was a 64-Unit ground up construction
- Built 64-Unit in 4 phases (16-Unit). In a town (Rome, New York) that was once
  Air Force base but town is abandoned. Slowly started developing.
- Providing luxury housing in economically down town. But tech was coming up
  there and they were "first to market" with luxury housing.
- "Deals create deals". Keep taking action and things may or may not work, but
  other things will present itself if you take action.
- The guy operates at a different level than I'm right now. Can't relate to lot
  of things he's saying, but maybe I'll do those one day. Not interested now.
