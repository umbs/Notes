GDB macro-coding language basic structure:

  define <command> 
  <code> 
  end 
  document <command> 
  <help text> 
  end 

When <command> is run, <code> is executed.
When help <command> is run, the <help text> is displayed. 

Enter this code in .gdbinit file and run GDB. 

Simple example: clear screen 
  define cls 
  shell clear 
  end 
  document cls 
  Clears the screen with a simple command 
  end 

User defined variables: 
  set $<var name>=<expression> 

  set $c=*(unsigned char *)($arg0)
 
Conditional Loops: 
  if - else - end 
  Same as other if() conditionals 

  while - end
  Same as other while() loop 
  
Calling user defined macros inside another macro: 
   <macro name> <arguments>
