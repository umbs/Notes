What are .LXXX labels in assembly?      
        .L prefix indicates label is local to this file and so it will not
        conflict with same name labels in other files. 
        .LFB0 = Function Begin 0 (1st function)
        .LFE0 = End of 1st Function
        .LFB1 = 2nd Function Begin
        etc 

GCC Flags: 
-fno-asynchronous-unwind-tables
        Call Frame Information [1] tags are used by GCC Assembler to
        reconstruct a stack backtrace. Some of .cfi labels look like: 
        .cfi_start_proc 
        .cfi_def_cfa_offset 
        .cfi_end_proc 
        .cfi_offset_cfa_register
