                   OTOOL      NOTES 
                   ================
'otool' comes as part of Xcode Tools that can act as replacement for
'objdump'. Objdump can be installed as part of binutils[1] but it is not
installed by default on Mac. Homebrew has it.  

Here are few flags of otool that I found useful: 

Sample Usage: 
      otool [ options ] <file> [ <file2> ... ]

Options: 
-l   Load commands are displayed. 
-t   Contents of __TEXT__ is displayed. Combined with -v flag to
     disassemble the text. Use -V to symbolically disassemble the
     operands. 
     
     Useful: otool -tVX test.o 

-d   Display __DATA__ section.  
-r   relocation entries. 
-X   avoid printing leading addresses. 




'dwarftool' (or dwarfdump) is another option that's available on Mac. It
is used only to dump/disassemble DWARF information from object file. More
to come ...
