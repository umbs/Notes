Week 4: Quadratic Equations and Graphing Parabolas
---
"Completing The Square"
---
- How to find minimum (or maximum) value of a quadratic expression?
- Make a square of expression (Completing The Square) and you'll get the min/max value of the parabola.
- Example: What is min value of
    x^2 + 10x + 22 ==> (x+5)^2 - 3

    Hence min value is -3

- For a quadratic equation: ax^2 + bx + c = 0, the roots are 
    x = (-b +- sqrt(b^2-4ac))/2a

"The Discriminant"
---
- The (b^2 - 4ac) under square root is called discriminant.
- If a, b, c are real numbers and if discriminant is positive then the roots of equation are real numbers.
- If discriminant is 0 then we get only one root (called 'double root').
- Sign of discriminant tells if quadratic has:
    - two real roots
    - two non-real roots
    - only one root

"Graphing Quadratics"
---
- Definition of Parabola: It is the set of points that are equidistant from a
  given line (called the directrix) and a point not on that line (called the
  focus).

- It turns out that every graph of an equation of the form
    y = ax^2 + bx + c
for constants a, b, and c is a parabola. (But not every parabola is an equation
of this form: if the directrix is slanted, you get a rotated parabola.)

- A parabola has a special point called the vertex, which is mid-way between
  the focus and the directrix. (That point must be on the parabola because it
is the midpoint between the focus and directrix, meaning that it has the same
distance from each.) The vertex for y = x^2 is at the origin (0,0)
