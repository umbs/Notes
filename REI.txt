======  CRUSHING IT IN APARTMENT AND COMMERCIAL RE   =============

Ch 4:
- Best investment property for small investor tend to be: multifamily (10-75
  units), multitenant retail, multitenant office and self-storage with strong
  cash flow.

- Small investors are better off choosing a market that avoids direct
  competition with big investors.

- Large investors look for Class A properties. Class C are sometimes
  overlooked and offer attractive opportunities.

Ch 5: Finding the right property

- Using Broker relationships
- Directly approaching property owners, using tax records etc
- Through contacts in property management companies
- Word of mouth from RE attorneys, accountants, lenders, contractors, fellow
  investors etc
- Auctions:
    * Risky to get financing (have to put lot of down payment)
    * Short window for closing
    * Use lot of caution

Ch 6: Analyzing properties
- NOI and cap rates give accurate picture on value of property
- Seller's Proforma's are _future_ potential and not _current_ income
- Always ask for following:
    * rent roll (actually, ask for bank deposits of the rent, which is even
      more accurate)
    * lease info (start and end dates)
    * Look at past 2-3 years income

- For commercial property, you may have following
    * Common Area Maintenance (CAM),
        + Parking lot maintenance
        + Snow removal
        + Landscaping
        + Utility bills (lighting, cooling etc)

- Expenses must be looked over a long period of time. Consider seasonal costs
  too.
