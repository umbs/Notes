                PERSONAL FINANCE PLAYLIST
                        (20 vids)
                =========================

Vid 1: What it means to buy a company's stock
-----
- Equity = (Assets - Liabilities)
- Theoretically, value of one share = Equity/Number of shares.
- If share price is greater than above theoretical value then people
  expect the company to do well. If its lower, people expect it to do
  badly??

- Current Assets = Value that can be 'converted' to cash/money in next one
  year.
- Current Liabilities = Money owed/debt to be payed in next one year.

Vid 2: Primer on unemployment rate
-----
- Total US population ~300M
- Total US population > 16 or more years of age (employable age) ~237M
- Actual Labor Force = Working population
                             +
                       Actively looking for work population
                     ~155M
- Unemployed People = Unemployed + Actively looking for work ~5M
- Unemployment Rate = (Unemployed People)/(Actual Labor Force) * 100
                    = (5M)/(155M)*100
                    = ~9.7%

- Does not account people entering and exiting labor force which can
  drastically affect the unemployment rate.


Vid 3: Traditional IRA (Individual Retirement Account)
-------
- Each individual can invest up to certain limit each year based on age.
  This limit is set by IRA and is usually high for people older than 50
  yrs.
- The money contributed to IRA is pre-taxed and will be taxed only when
  taking it out.
- There is a penalty of 10% for early withdrawl of IRA money. Cut off date
  is 59.5yrs.


Case Study:
-----
An individual with income in 32% tax bracket contributs $5000 to IRA. How
does he fare contributing (& investing) through IRA versus investing by
himself (without IRA).

                                IRA                     No IRA
                             ---------               ------------
Starting Amount                $5000                $5000 * 32% = $3400

Invest in stock A
for 10yrs and amount
doubles                       $10,000                 $6800

After tax, amount left        $10,000               $6800 - ($3400*15%)
                           (won't pay tax           = $6290
                           because money is        (15% tax on $3400
                           still with IRA)           capital gains)

Invest in stock B
for 10yrs and amount
doubles                       $20,000                  $12,580


After tax, amount left        $20,000             $12,580 - ($6290*15%)
                                                  = $11,636.50

If you are over 59.5yrs
now and eligible to
withdraw. Say you earn
much less now and fall
in 25% tax bracket

------------------------------------------------------------------------
After tax, amount left        $15,000                 $11,636.50
------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is made up scenario and most likely/probable one.


Vid 4: The rule of 72 for compound interest
---------
- A simple rule to describe how long does it take for a principal amount
to double, given an interest rate R%: 72/R
        Ex: R = 10% per annum.
            It takes 7.2yrs to double the principal amount.

            R = 10% per month.
            It takes 7.2months to double.

- Actual formula:
        Let P0 = principal amount right now.
        Let P1 = Total amount after 1 year.
        Let Pn = Total amount after n years.
        Let R  = Interest rate per year.

        Pn = P0 + P1 + P2 + ...
           = P0(1+R/100)^n


Vid 5: Term and Whole Life Insurance Policies
---------
- Term Insurace: Policy on life for a certain term (say 10yrs).
        - Pay yearly premium of, say, $500 for 10yrs for a payoff to
          beneficiary upon death within 10yrs.
        - If no death then you loose whole money.
        - If the term length is longer, premiums are higher due to higher
          probability of death.
        - Premiums go up with age.
        - This plan is not available after a certain age (like 70yrs or
          so).

- Life Insurace: Policy taken out for the whole life.
        - Premiums are much higher than Term Insurance.
        - Payout is after death to beneficiary.
        - Optional savings plan associated with Life Insurance where a
          certain % interest is given on your premium.
        - If you opt out of LI policy before death, you can take out the
          savings at a certain fee.
        - However, upon death, only the Insurance payout will be provided
          to beneficiary. The cash savings is lost and will not be paid to
          beneficiary.


Vid 6: Roth IRA
----------
- Named after William Roth, Delaware Senator who proposed this bill.
- Roth IRA is post tax investment.
- Principal can be withdrawn anytime without penalty.
- If more than principal is withdrawn (if principal increases) then 10%
penalty and income tax is applied.
- After 59.5yrs, only income tax is applied on amount (except principal).




                        Traditional IRA         Roth IRA
                        --------------------------------
Initial: $5000             $5000               $3400 (at 32% tax)
deposit                (tax deferred)

Investment doubles         $10000              $6800
but stays in IRA

Investment doubles         $20000              $13600
again but stays in IRA

Ex 1:
Withdraw $3400 before   $3400-($340 penalty)    $3400-(1088 at 32% tax)
59.5yrs                 - ($1088 at 32% tax)    = $2312
                        = $1972

Ex 2:
Withdraw $4000 before   $4000-($400 penalty)    No tax on $3400.
59.5yrs                 -($1280 at 32% tax)     On $600, 10% penalty +
                        = $2320                 32% income tax = $348
                                                Total = $3748.

Ex 3:
Withdraw after 59.5yrs  $15000                  No tax on $3400 +
at 25% tax rate         (after tax)             25% on $10200
                                                = $11050



Vid 8: Personal Bankruptcy - Chapters 7 and 13
------
- Defaulting on debt and a legal process to handle that is defined in
  Bankruptcy laws. Chapt 7 & 13 are the most common and applies to
  individuals.

- Mideval times, if one fails to repay the debt, there was a concept of
  'debt labor' - repaying in form of labor.
- In early 18th century, there were debt prisons. Charles Dicken's dad was
  in debt prison. Family has to repay the loan/debt and free the debtor.

Chapt 7:
-------
- Chap 7 is a stronger, straight forward declaration of Bankruptcy.
- You go to bankruptcy court and declare it. They appoint an assessor, who
  takes all your assets, within reasonable limits, sell it off and pay the
  creditors.
- This stays on credit report for 10 yrs.


Chapt 13:
-----
- Much lenient than Chap 7, this is asking court to reduce the interest
  rates, or debt amount or some thing similar. It is still promising to
  return the debt, but negotiating the terms & conditions.
- This also stays on credit report for 10 yrs.


- Other chapters of Bankruptcy law deals with other types of situations:
  Chapter 12 is related to food producers (farmers, fisher men etc);
  Chapter 11 is related to insitutions, but some individuals with vast
  assets can also fall in this category.

- Certain loans/debts cannot be waived under Bankruptcy laws. Student loan
  is one.


Vid 9: Open Ended Mutual Funds
-------
- Imagine someone wants to start an investment fund, they go to SEC,
  incorporate themselves and start soliciting funds from public. They have
  to pass all regulatory hurdles first.
- Hedge Funds cannot solicit funds from general public.

- Suppose, we start a fund with $400 investment and 4 shares. So, Total
  Assets Under Management (AUM) is $400.
- If someone wants to invest, fund can issue new shares at $100 each. Let
  say, new AUM is $500 (total 5 shares).
- The Net Asset Value (NAV) is $100/share.
- If fund performs well and grows to $1000, the new NAV is $200.
- If someone wants 10 new shares, the fund manager can create new ones and
  issue them, making AUM to $2000.
- If a particular year, fund looses 10%, AUM is now $1800.
- If one investor wants his money back, the fund AUM reduces to $1620.
  Note that NAV still remains same, $180.
- Drawback of Open Ended MF is that manager has to have some cash reserve
  to return investors (typically 3-5%)
- OEMF can grow or shrink frequently (without affective NAV in above
  example).


Vid 10: Intro to Mortgage Loans
---------

Vid 11: Intro to Compound Interest
---------




Vid 12: Intro to Bonds
---------
- Companies or Govt or any institutions can raise funds in two ways:
  (a) Borrow from a bank (b) Issue bonds

- In the case of bonds (from what I understand), there are a lot many
  investors and hence distributing the risk. Compare this to a bank
  lending the entire sum. If the institution defaults, the bank bears a
  heavy loss.

- Similar to a loan, in Bonds, there is a Maturity Date, Interest Rate and
  Coupons (dates when the interest on principal is disbursed).
- Typically, interests are payed semi-annually.

- Ex: If a Company wants to raise $5M capital, they can issue 5000 bonds
  at $1000 face value (par value), at an interest rate of 10% and 2yr
  maturity. This is how the bond pays out.

  -------------+--------------+---------------+------------------+
  0           6m             12m             18m                24m
  -$1000     +$50            +50            +$50              +$50
                                                              +$1000

- From Company's perpective:

        Initial Asset
        +---------+
        | $10M    |
        +---------+

        After issuing bonds
           Asset    Debt/Liabilities
        +---------+---------+
        | $10M    |  $5M    |
        +---------+---------+

        If Company's assets grow to, say, $20M, bond holders DO NOT
        benefit. They only get what's promised to them.



Vid 13: Institutional roles in issuing and processing credit cards
---------

Vid 14: Basics of Estate Tax
---------
+ Also called inheritence tax.
+ No tax up to $5M. But taxed 10% on anything above.
+ This tax is when estate is inherited from an individual. But when
inherited from joint (couple), its a different rate.

Vid 15: Basics of US income tax rate
------

Vid 16: APR and Effective APR
-------
+ Credit Cards announce an APR value (say, 22%) and in fine print mention
a daily interest rate of 0.06027% (=22/365)
+ However, if we compound this interest, the effective APR =
(1.0006027)^365 ~ 24.59%
+ Note that due to compounding, the effective interest is a bit higher.


Vid 17: 401K
--------
+ Similar to Traditional IRA.
+ Differences:
        - Larger limit to invest in 401K.
        - In 401K Company matches and theoretically, a generous employer
          can match a lot of money. There is a limit of combined
          contribution of $50K.
        - Traditional IRA give flexibility to invest anywhere. 401K is
          tied to options given by employer.
        - Not so important, in 401K, the money is automatically deducted
          from paycheck while in Traditional IRA, we have to invest after
          receiving the paycheck. Tax deductions happens at end of the
          year.

Vid 18, 19, 20:
-----


                FINANCE (196 vids)
                ==================
Vid 1,2: Interest
-----
P = Principal, R = Rate of Interest (in %), N = Number of years
F = Future Amount

Simple Interest:
F = P + P*N*(R/100)

Compound Interest:
F = P(1+R/100)^N


Vid 3,4,5: Present Value
------
PV = Present Value; FV = Future Value; R = Interest (in %); N = Number of
years.

FV = PV (1+R/100)^N

+ Sometimes R is called discount.


Vid 6: Discounted Cash Flow
-----
+ Varying interest rates, such as deposits for long term vs deposits for
short term.
+ Best way to compare various choices, caculate PV for all choices and
evaluate.


Vid 7, 8, 9: Intro to Balance Sheets
-------
- Assets = All that you own and can be converted to cash (car, house,
  cash). House is an example of Asset. However, there could be mortgage on
  the house and hence we don't have 100% ownership.
- Liabilities = Anything that you owe others (debt, loan, mortgage etc).
- Equity = Something that you are 100% owner of, mostly calculated in
  cash.

- Assets = Liabilities + Equity.

           House (1M Asset)
        +------------+
        | 750K load  | <--- Liability
        |            |
        +------------+
        | 250K yours | <-- Equity
        +------------+

- As you pay off the loan, the principal portion goes towards Equity.
- If the house value drops to, say, $800K. Then, since Liability remians
  same, the loss is in owners Equity.
- If the house value increases, to say, $1.5M, then owners Equity
  increases to $750K.
- Home Equity Loan: Getting a loan if Equity on home increases as above.
  Usually, banks only give loan up to 75% of home value if Equity
  increases. In above case, 75% of $1.5M is $1.125M. Since bank already
  gave $750K loan, it can give additional $375K loan.


Vid 10, 11, 12: Renting vs Buying
-------
- Renting or Buying, this is how to do analysis.

- Params for buying: $1M house with $250K downpayment, i.e., $750K loan @
  5% interest, say $5K/mo in mortgage = $60K/yr in mortgage
- If initially, the interest component is 2/3 of that amount (=$40K), that is tax
  deductible. By rough calculation (at 33% tax rate), about 1/3 is
  recovered (=$13K). Hence, we pay about $47K towards a home mortgage,
  EFFECTIVELY.

- Params for renting (similar house as above): $3K/mo = $36K/yr and assume
  there is a 4% interest on $250K (=$10K/yr). With this income, effective
  "loss" per year is $26K/yr
- There is almost $20K difference, which we'll never see if we buy a home.



Vid 13, 14, 15, 16: Housing Price Conundrum
------
- What is reason for Housing Price Connundrum from 2000 to 2006 in USA?
- Money has become easy to get. Banks were lending money, for literally
  zero downpayment.
- Banks or Financial Institutions, such as Country Wide Financials, were
  bundling Billions of loands and selling them off to bigger banks (such
  as Bear Sterns) and getting commissions on the loans made.
- Bear Sterns were selling them to Hedge Funds or other such Financial
  Institutions, where a pool of investors put their money.
- Investors of Hedge Fund depended on Standard & Poors (S&P), Moody's
  Investor Services and Fitch Ratings to rate the quality of loans. They
  are the big 3 credit-rating agencies.
- These agencies gave AAA (or such highest quality) rating because these
  mortgage owners never defaulted in the past.
- Hedge Fund and such investors invested because its an easy 7-8% returns
  on their investment.


Vid 19, 20, 21: Short Selling
------
Mechanics of Shorting:
- Borrow stocks/shares from owners via broker. Sell it in market and wait,
  in the hopes that share price will fall. Buy back the stock at lower
  price and return the shares to the owner via broker. Difference in stock
  price is profit.

- Making money when market (or shares) is going in downward direction.

- Is it bad? Almost all players in market benefit from share price going
  up (Company execs, Financial media, Financial service providers, Govt,
  etc). Short sellers are on other side. They benefit when shares go down
  and can check 'misbehavior' of people who can influence share price
  going up.


Vid 22
-----
- There are two types of Bankruptcy: (a) Liquidation (b) Reorganization.

Liquidation:
----
- Usually done when companies don't do well at all. Banks sell off the
  assets and pay off debtors.
- There will be negotiations between all debt holders and equity holders
  and all that stuff.
- Who gets this money? First Debtors. But there are levels/seniority among
  them.
- 'Senior Secure Debt' holders will be first to get money. Next are
  'Senior Unsecure Debt' holders. Then 'Subordinate' then 'Junior' etc.
  There is a hierarcy. Lower in the hierarcy, lower are the returns (if
  company does NOT go in to bankruptcy) because they take more risk.
- 'Senior Secure' debt holders get least interest on their money because
  their money is 'gauranteed' to be returned.
- If any money is left after paying off debtors, its shared among equity
  holders.

                UNDERSTANDING   FINANCIAL   MARKETS
                ===================================

Week 1:
-------
GENERAL CONCEPTS:
-----
Key takeaways when investing in bonds:
    * Be aware of limitations of benchmarking in bond market.
    * Consider the fundamentals of borrower you lend to.
    * Lower the starting yield, lower the expected return.
    * Buy bonds if you expect a macroeconomic slowdown and vice versa.

Key takeaways when investing in equities:
    * Be aware of limitations of benchmarking in equity market.
    * Strong GDP growth does not always imply higher equity returns.
    * Don't chase past performance.
    * Look for truly active managers.

Participants in Financial Markets:
    * Firms looking to raise money.
    * Investors.
    * Government - Insures market integrity, protect investors from price abuse.
    * Intermediaries - Brokers, Market Makers etc.

+ Ratio of Value of equity market vs GDP indicates ...

+ What is the function of financial markets?
    * Pooling of resources (like money) and subdividing shares of companies so
      that investors can own part of it.
    * Trasfering resources across time and space.
    * Managing risks. Three suggested ways:
        - Diversify.
        - Insurance by purchasing derivative products.
        - Securitization - Not sure I understood this.
    * Providing information for buyers and sellers.

+ Expectations from well functioning Financial Markets:
    * Trading info: price, volume, order book ...; all this must be available to
      all participants.
    * Trading technology:
    * Company info:
    * Market opportunities:


BASIC CONCEPTS:
-----
+ Returns (well understood, but neverthless) of stock A:
                July            August
    Price       100             101

        Return: 101-100
                ------- = 1%
                  100

+ Now, which of following stock has higher return?
                July    August  September
    Stock A     1%      1%      13%
    Stock B     13%     3%      2%

    Average monthly returns is:
    Stock A: 5%
    Stock B: 6%

    Stock B is better.

+ Risk
                July    August  September
    Stock A     1%      1%      13%
    Stock B     5%      5%      5%

    Both stocks average the same. Which one to buy?
    Stock B because it's "risk-free"

                July    August  September
    Stock A     7%      10%     13%
    Stock B     9%      10%     11%

    Stock B is risk-free because of less variability.

+ Return-Risk Tradeoff
    * We want higher return.
    * We want less risk.
    * Use average return vs risk ratio. Higher this ratio, better it is.

+ Summary:
    * Compute average returns over a period of time instead of a point in time.
    * Calculate Return-Risk ratio. Higher ratio is better.
    * Draw up a histogram of window of return (0-10%, 10-20% etc) and number of
      times you got those returns, divided by total number of returns.


Week 2:
-------

+ DISCOUNTING: Mechanism used in finance to estimate today's value of an amount
of money to be received in the future.

How Much is a Company Worth in Stock Market?
----
+ NET PRESENT VALUE (NPV) Rule is typically used in evaluating value.

    NPV = PV (Benefits) - PV (Costs)

    * invest in projects with positive NPV.

Example 1:

    -150        20      50      70      70  <-- cash flows
     |----------|-------|--------|-------|
    t=0       t=1      t=2      t=3     t=4 <--- time

If the discount rate is 10%, what is the NPV of the project?

    NPV = -150 + 20/(1.10) + 50/(1.10)^2 + 70/(1.10)^3 + 70/(1.10)^4
        = 9.91

    NPV is positive and thus invest.


Example 2:

    100        -90      20     -90      40  <-- cash flows
     |----------|-------|--------|-------|
    t=0       t=1      t=2      t=3     t=4 <--- time

If the discount rate is 10%, what is the NPV of the project?

    NPV = 100 - 90/(1.10) + 20/(1.10)^2 - 90/(1.10)^3 + 40/(1.10)^4
        = -5.59

    NPV is negative and thus do not invest.

+ EQUITY: A firms equity = Assets - Liabilities.
    * Equity is split in to many small chunks called "shares".

+ Two important rights that come with owning shares.
    * If firm were to liquidate, after payoff of liabilities, shareholders get a
      portion of what is leftover.
    * Receive part of dividends.

+ Which methods do investors use to value companies?
    * Discounted cash flow (DCF).
    * Valuation based on comparable firms (multiples).

+ DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW:
    - What cashflow to use? Free Cash Flow (FCF), that firm has available to pay
      _all_ investors, both debt and equity holders.
    - We forecast FCFs over an explicit forecast horizon of N years.

+ Cash flows beyond the forcast horizon is assumed to grow at a constant rate: g
+ This assumption allows us to compute "terminal value" that represents the
  value of the firm from end of explicit forecast horizon onwards.

    Terminal Value = V
    Growth rate beyond explicit forecast horizon = g
    Weighted average cost of capital = r

    V = ((1+g)/(r-g)) x FCF

+ Which discount rate to be used (what is 'r' in above equation?)
    - Weighted average cost of capital (WACC). It is the average cost of capital
      the firm must pay to all it's investors.
    - It corresponds to the expected return of investors in company.

+ Enterprise value (V) is:

    V0 = FCF1/(1+r) + FCF2/(1+r)^2 + FCF3/(1+r)^3 + ... FCFn/(1+r)^n

+ Price of one share P:
    P0 = (V0-Debt0)/Shares Outstanding0


+ Example

         2016   2017    2018    2019    2020
    -----------------------------------------
    FCF  100    110     120     127     134

    - From 2020, firm will grow at 4%.
    - Firms WACC is 12%
    - Has 500 million USD in debt.
    - Has 100 miliion outstanding shares.

    What is the price of one share?

    V0 = 100/1.12 + 110/1.12^2 + 120/1.12^3 + 127/1.12^4 + (134+1742)/1.12^5
        = USD 1407.60 million, value of the company.

    **** The $1742 is the terminal value at year 5 of that company.

+ Price of one share = (1407.60-500)/100 = 9.08 USD



+ VALUATION BY MULTIPLES:
    It's a 3 step process:
    * Find comparable listed firms.
    * Compute ratio of Market Value/Earnings.
    * Infer value of company of interest.


Example 1:
+ We want to value privately held firm A.com
+ Has earnings of $10 million.
+ Comparable listed e-commerce firms have P/E of 20.
+ Value of A.com = 10 * 20 = $200 million.


Example 2:
+ Want to value privately held firm B Inc.
+ EBITDA = $30.7 mil
+ Has 5.4 mil shares outstanding and debt of $125 mil.
+ Comparable firms have Enterprise Value to EBITDA multiple of 7.4
+ What is value of one share of B Inc?

+ Enterprise Value = 7.4 * 30.7 = $227.18 mil
+ Subtracting debt and dividing by outstanding shares
    P = (227.18 - 125)/5.4 = $18.92


OTHER MULTIPLES:
+ Depending on industry, various multples exists:
    * P/E ratio = Market Cap/Net Income
    * EBITDA multiple = Enterprise Value/EBITDA
    * EBIT multiple = Enterprise Value/EBIT
    * Sales multiple = Enterprise Value/Sales
    ...

+ HOw to choose a multiple?
    * One that's operating in same industry.

COUPON

PRINCIPAL

MATURITY

DURATION - It's weighted average maturity of a bond's cash flow. It is an
average of the times (in years) until the payment of each cash flow.

    Duration = Equilibrium point of all the PV of cash flows (coupons and
               principal)

Example: Cash flow chart.
    First coupon: 1 year
    Second coupon: 2 years
    Third coupon: 3 years
    Fourth coupon: 4 years
    Fifth coupon + Principal: 5 years

    What is the simple (ie., non-weighted) average of these different times (in
    years).

    = (1+2+3+4+5)/5 = 3 years.

- Remember the experiment shown by professor. Water was poured a little bit in
  different glasses (representing coupons) and a big bottle (representing
  principal). They were all placed on wooden beam. The beam was balanced on
  small block (obviously, the block is off of center). This position of the
  block represents Duration.


YIELD

YIELD TO MATURITY: It's the Internal Rate of Return (IRR) you get on a bond if
you hold it until maturity and all cash flows are paid as agreed.

Example:
Suppose you pay $95 for a bond, maturing in 1 year, with coupon of $5 and face
value of $100 (ie., you get $100 back at maturity + $5 as coupon)

What is Yield to Maturity of this bond?
    (105-95)/95 = 10.53%

What is rationale for lower bond price when yield is high?

The value/price of a bond:
    Price = sum of all cash flow in present value + principal in present value
    This is same as NPV formula.

FACE VALUE:


AT PAR:


- Bonds are issued in domestic currency.
- It's backed by full faith of government.


Benefits:
- Pre-determined stream of revenue (coupons), including the capital at maturity.
- Seen as low risk because it depends on probability of government defaulting,
  which is very low.
-


Risks in Investing in Bonds:
-----
- There are 5 types of risks in bonds
    * Economic
    * Political
    * Interest Rate
    * Inflation
    * Currency

* Economic Risk: Like Greece, Argentina. Govt can default. Govt some times can
raise tax, which will make investors to ask more returns.

* Political Risk: Similar to Economic but slightly different. Govt can devalue
currency, for instance, to boost export. It happened in Russia around 1998.
Existing bond holders will loose lot of money because Russian bonds will loose
credit rating. To attract investors, Govt has to issue higher yield. Therefore,
existing bond holders (with lower interest rates) will have bonds no one wants
(thus lowering it's price in bond market).

* Interest Rate Risk: This is captured by "Duration" of the bond.
    (Approximate) percent change in the price of bond =
            -D(delta r/(1+r)) x 100

    D = duration
    delta r = change in interest rates
    r = current interest rate

Example: How interest rate changes impact bond prices.
    D = 6.55, r = 10%, r increases to 12%, price of bond is $100.

    -D (delta r/(1+r)) x 100
    = -6.55 (.02/1.1) x 100 = -11.91%

    - This is the drop in price of "existing" bond.


* Inflation Risk: Since fixed coupons are given to investors, if inflation goes
up a lot, the coupon's has less buying power (and it's fixed). The new bonds
will carry more yield to attract investors. Existing bonds will loose value.


* Currency Risk: If a US investor buys Japanese Govt bonds and Yen goes down in
value against Dollar, then there is risk of making loss.


Corporate and High Yield Bonds:
---
- Global debt market is 3 times larger than global stock market.

    Bond Yield = Risk Free Interest + Risk Premium

    // I didn't understand above equation.


Money Markets
---
- What are reasons for holding cash.
    * cash consumption (paying bills)
    * Iron reserve (to cover unforseen events - sickness, accidents etc). Can be
      viewed as insurance.
    * Portfolio Protection - If investor sees lower returns or prices falling,
      they may hold money to use it buy assets later at cheaper value. But this
      is risky as investor is trying to time market.

- For above reasons, investors may hold excess cash. It is a drag on their
  portfolio returns and opportunity costs.

- Inflation equates loss in money if holding cash.


Currencies - A Separate Asset Class
-----------------------------------

- Currencies represent LARGEST financial asset.
- There are two ways of defining currencies in FOREX market.
    Direct Quote:
        - Number of units of domestic currency corresponding to 1 unit of
          foreign currency:
        - Examples, for Swiss Franc based investor:
            + .99 CHF = 1 USD
            + 1.08 CHF = 1 EUR
        - It is norm in all countries except: UK, Australia, New Zealand,
          Canada and Eurozone.

    Indirect Quote:
        - Number of units of foreign currencies corresponding to 1 unit of
          domestic currency.
        - It is norm in UK, Australia, New Zealand, Canada and Eurozone.
        - Ex:
            + 1 EUR = 1.09 USD
            + 1 AUD = 0.71 USD


What's real value of currency?
---
- There are many yard sticks to measure the value of currency.

- A method called: Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) is popular. It is used to
  estimate a _theoretical_ exchange rate between two currencies.

- Ex: Say a basket of goods costs $100. Same costs 110 CHF (Swiss Franc). If PPP
  holds then 1 USD = 1.1 CHF. Then CHF and USD has same purchasing power.

- Ex: Suppose we have 4 burgers in 4 different countries


                                    Exchange Rates
                                    --------------
        Cost of Burger      USD     PPP     July, 05    Over or Undervalued vs
        (local currency)                                USD
US          4.79            4.79

China       17              2.74    3.55    6.21        -42.84%

Swiss       6.50            6.82    1.36    0.95        +42.84%

India       116.25          1.83    24.27   63.43       -61.74%





Relative PPP
------------
- Compare changing prices of a basket of goods and not absolute prices between
  basket of goods between currencies.

    PPP rate = E x (PP*)

    where E = nominal exchange rate between currencies.
        P = domestic inflation
        P* = foriegn inflation

// Watch this video again.


Risk-Adjusted Returns
----
    Sharpe Ratio = (Total Return - Risk Free Rate)
                    -----------------------------
                        Standard   Deviation

Ex:
US Treasuries
                   4% - 1%
    Sharpe Ratio = ------- = 0.3
                      5%

US Equities

                   14% - 1%
    Sharpe Ratio = ------- = 1.3
                      10%



Alternative Asset Classes
-------------------------
[1] Emerging Markets Stocks

- What are Emerging Markets? The ratio of Market Cap to GDP is an indicator of
  market development. Swiss, US and UK have this ratio in excess of 100%, while
  many other countries are below 100% (vis India, Thailand, China, Brazil etc).

- Not all of the market cap is investible. So, a new term is introduced: IWF

- Investable Weight Factor (IWF) and Free Float

    IWF = 1 - sum (% held by strategic shareholders)

    Ex:
    Stock A                 # of shares         %
    ------------------------------------------------
    Total Shares            1,000,000          100%
    Family members holding  200,000            20%
    Govt holding            100,000            10%
    Holding by publicly     100,000            10%
     traded company "B"

    IWF = 100% - (20%+10%+10%) = 60%
    // aka Free Float.

- Investibility also depends on foreign ownership limits, set by Govts.

- Understand the risks in EM. There are many:
    * Political
    * Macroeconomic
    * Liquidity
    * Currency


[2] Emerging Markets Bonds

- When investing in EM bonds (aka Sovereign Bonds), the Yield Spread plays an
  important rold.

    Yield Spread = Yield on EM dollar denominated bond (with maturity 'm')
                    - Yield on US Treasury (with same maturity 'm')

    Examples:
    * Yield on 10 yr Brazil dollar denominated bond = 7%
    * Yield on 10 yr US Treasury bond = 2%
    * Yield spread = 7%-2% = 5% (or 500 basis points [bp])

What are the risks?
---

- Interest Rate Risk
- Country and Credit Risk
- Currency Risk: Only for local currency denominated bond.
- Liquidity Risk - Has higher costs


Emerging Markets and Gold
Gold: The Ultimate Currency?
----------------------------
- Gold moves inversely to dollar movement. Why? Gold is priced in USD. When USD
  falls, the attractiveness to purchase/invest in Gold for non-US investor
  increases and Gold is bought.

- Gold is seen as "save haven" and whenever there is political tension, price of
  Gold increases.

- Gold price increases with inflation.

- What is the cost of "owning" Gold? There is an opportunity cost such as money
  spent on storing it in safe box.

- Ketchup Inflation: When central banks embark on money printing to support
money spending, people loose faith in currency. They start buying goods (or
Gold) thinking cost of goods will go up due to inflation (caused by money
printing). This increases velocity in money circulation, resulting in more
inflation, thus triggering something called: Hyper Inflation. Gold is then used
as insurance and people purchase it. This type of event is called Black Swan
events, very unlikely, but if it happens, has devastating effects.



Real Estate
-----------
- World Wide Commercial Real Estate is worth $34 trillion and about 20%. Bonds
  are 45% and Stocks 35%

- Return and Risk

US 1990-2015        Real Estate     Stocks      Bonds
Avg Return (%)      9.0             10.5        6.3
Volatility (%)      11.5            15.9        5.1
Sharpe Ratio        0.51            0.46        0.63

Correlation with
Real Estate                         0.04        0.00


- Financial Benefits:
    * International diversification is very beneficial
    * Hedge against inflation. If inflation goes up, Real Estate goes up,
      largely because rents go up as well.




Hedge Funds
-----------

- Uses LEVERAGE and SHORT SELLING to make money.
- Fee: 2% and 20% commission on performance.

- Alfred William Jones started 1st Hedge Fund in 1949 and by 1964 outperformed
  market significantly, hence the phrase: Keeping up with Jones.

- LEVERAGE: It's borrowing money to increase profits (if fund gains).
  Unfortunately, it goes both ways. You'll loose a lot if fund goes down.

- Is LEVERAGE = Risk?
    Yes

- SHORT SELLING:
    - We borrow stock/shares from bank, sell it, keep the money at the
      bank/broker as collateral. We CANNOT use that money. After the price
      falls, you can use that money to buy shares back and return the shares to
      the bank and keep the profit.

- Are the risks in long vs short positions same? No.

    Ex. If long position makes losses but portfolio is same, what is the losses?

    At time=0                   At time=later
    Stock A: $100               Stock A: $20 // 80% loss
    Rest: $900                  Rest: $980  // making total portfolio same.
    Total: $1000                Total: $1000
    ------------                ---------------
    Stock = 10% of portfolio    Stock = 2% of portfolio


    Ex: If short position goes wrong

    At time=0                   At time=later
    Stock A: $100               Stock A: $120 // 20% loss
    Rest: $900                  Rest: $880  // making total portfolio same.
    Total: $1000                Total: $1000
    ------------                ---------------
    Stock = 10% of portfolio    Stock = 12% of portfolio
    Now the Stock is 12% of portfolio and has more exposure.


Private Markets
---------------
- Consider having investment in Private Markets in your portfolio.




Financial Markets and Economy
-----------------------------

Role of Central Banks: Has 3 goals (for US Fed Reserve)
---------------------
    * Maximum employment.
    * Stable prices.
    * Moderate long term interest rates.

    // Other central banks have slightly varying goals/mandates.

- When economy is slowing down, it's advisable to increase relative weight of
  bonds in you portfolio.

- Jan Tinbergen (first Nobel Laureate in Economics) said that you need as many
  tools as there are objectives for Central Bank policies.
    Ex: If Central Bank is targeting both inflation and employment, interest
        rates alone will not do that job if stagflation prevails.
        // Brazil is currently (yr 2016) experiencing this.

- It is FAR easier for Central Bank to cool an overheating economy (stop growth)
  than to stimulate an economy (stimulate growth).


Link between equity markets and growth inflation.
----
- Economic growth (measured by GDP) need not mean high equity returns (S&P
  Index).
- During economic slowdown, choose bonds, during economic recovery buy stocks,
  a.k.a: Equities for recoveries, bonds for slowdowns.
-

	                Strong GDP Growth

	                        |
	                Low GDP Growth


Alternate Definition of Market Conditions (Regime)
------

    Regime                  Frequency           Real Return
    ------                  ---------           -----------
    Warming                 46%                 7.5%
    Perfection              16%                 14.6%
    Cooling                 20%                 12.0%
    Too Hot                 11%                 -5.9%
    Too Cold                7%                  -21.6%


Warming = Starting off from a rising growth regime, we have inflation picking up
to the point where it slows down growth (most likely subsequent to a tightening
of monetary policy).

Too Hot: rising inflation chokes off growth.

Cooling: growth falls further and brings inflation along.

Too Cold: to the point where inflation turns negative and activity contracts
severely (deflation).

Perfection: growth is positive and inflation is low.




Link between Bond Markets and Growth-Inflation Mix
-----------
- Yield Curve: It's Yield vs Time to Maturity graph.
- Normal Yield Curve is upward sloping, meaning that long maturity terms have
  higher yields and vice versa.
- Inverted Yiled Curve is possible but not common. Yield is high on short term
  bonds.
- When Central Banks want a easier monetary policy, they lower interest rates
  and increase interest rates when they want a tighter monetary policy.

- Short Term interest rates are determined by Central Banks. Long Term are
  determined by Stocks and Bonds and market conditions, generally.

- Slope of Yield Curve can be predictor of economic activity, especially when
  Banks conduct conventional monetary policy. But not so much when Banks conduct
  "unconventional" monetary policy (like Quantitative Easing).




How Interest Rates effect Equity Markets
-----------

    NPV = sum from t=1 to T (Ct /(1+r)^t) - C0

    C0 = Initial cash outflow (Cost of project or price of asset etc).
    Ct = Net cash inflow during period 't'
    r = discount rate
    T = total number of time periods.

- When interest rates go down, stock/equity goes up (generally) unless economic
  activity slows down. Vice versa is true as well.



How Interest Rates effect Bond Markets
-----------


    Bond Price = sum from t=1 to N [Coupon at t/(1+YTM)^t] + Principal/(1+YTM)^N

- There is perfect correlation between short term interest rates and performance
  of bond market. If one goes up, other does too and vice versa.

- Bond returns increase as interest rates falls and vice versa.
- Duration must be used to adjust your bond portfolio to expected changes in
  yield curve.
