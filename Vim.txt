Window Splitting
----------------
:vsp // Vertical split
:sp  // Horizontal split
:vsp <file> // Opens <file> in new window
:10sp // Specify split height
:set splitright // Opens window in right [for vertical splits] and becomes
                  active
:set splitbelow // same for horizontal window

ctrl+w is same as :wincmd
    * Wherever we use ctrl+w, we can do :wincmd

ctrl+w <number> < // reduce width of window by <number>
ctrl+w <number> > // increase width of window by <number>
<number> ctrl+w +   // increase length of window by <number>
<number> ctrl+w -   // decrease length of window by <number>
ctrl+w | // max out window width
ctrl+w _ // max out window height
ctrl+w = // normalize all window sizes (equal sizes)
ctrl+w R // swap both windows [including buffers]

<number> ctrl+w w // switch to window <number>
ctrl+w T // make current split window in to a tab (capital T)

gf          ("goto file") Open file under cursor in current window
ctrl+w f    Open file under cursor in (horizontal) split window
ctrl+w gf   Open file under cursor in new tab
More details here: https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Open_file_under_cursor


vim -O file1 file2 // open two files side by side

Tab Views
----------
:tabnew <file> // opens <file> in a new tab
:tabp // previous tab
:tabn // next tab

In Normal mode
gt // go to next tab
gT // go to previous tab
ngt // got to tab no. n

vim -p file1 file 2 // open multiple files in tab mode


Regular Expressions
-------------------
. (dot)	Any single character except newline
*	zero or more occurances of any character
[...]	Any single character specified in the set
[^...]	Any single character not specified in the set
^	Anchor - beginning of the line
$	Anchor - end of line
\<	Anchor - begining of word
\>	Anchor - end of word
\(...\)	Grouping - usually used to group conditions
\n	Contents of nth grouping

[...] - Set Examples
--------------------
[A-Z]	The SET from Capital A to Capital Z
[a-z]	The SET from lowercase a to lowercase z
[0-9]	The SET from 0 to 9 (All numerals)
[./=+]	The SET containing . (dot), / (slash), =, and +
[-A-F]	The SET from Capital A to Capital F and the dash (dashes must be specified first)
[0-9 A-Z]	The SET containing all capital letters and digits and a space
[A-Z][a-zA-Z]	In the first position, the SET from Capital A to Capital Z
In the second character position, the SET containing all letters

Regular Expression Examples
---------------------------
/Hello/	Matches if the line contains the value Hello
/^TEST$/	Matches if the line contains TEST by itself
/^[a-zA-Z]/	Matches if the line starts with any letter
/^[a-z].*/	Matches if the first character of the line is a-z and there is at least one more of any character following it
/2134$/	Matches if line ends with 2134
/\(21|35\)/	Matches if the line contains 21 or 35
Note the use of ( ) with the pipe symbol to specify the 'or' condition
/[0-9]*/	Matches if there are zero or more numbers in the line
/^[^#]/	        Matches if the first character is not a # in the line

Notes:
1. Regular expressions are case sensitive
2. Regular expressions are to be used where pattern is specified


Very good resource on Vim Regex
--------------------------------

Substituting Tips
-----------------
Save typing by using \zs and \ze to set the start and end of a pattern.
For example, instead of:

:s/Copyright 2007 All Rights Reserved/Copyright 2008 All Rights Reserved/

Use:

:s/Copyright \zs2007\ze All Rights Reserved/2008/


Diff
----
vimdiff file1 file2 // diff two files side by side


Cursor Positioning
------------
zt puts current line to top of screen
z. or zz puts current line to center of screen
zb puts current line to bottom of screen

Ref: http://unix.stackexchange.com/a/110252/45157

Code Folding
------------
Reference - :help folding
            :help za
            :help zo
            :help zc

Synopsis - Using commands here, code in a file can be temporarily folded
[hidden]. Folding helps in navigating a file quickly as parts of the file
is hidden.

zc - close a fold
zo - open a fold
za - toggle a fold [open if its closed and vice versa]

zC, zO, zA are similar but inner folding levels are also affected by them,
not just the level at which cursor is present.


Page Scroll
-----------
^d ^u   Scroll half a page down or up
^f ^b   Scroll full page up or down

Reformatting
------------
In the .vimrc file, `set textwidth=80` (or whatever column width).
gg  - go to top of file
gqG - globally set the entire file to 80 width column. It joins lines. If you
        dont want lines to be joined, have a blank one in between.
gq} - change only current paragraph
G   - go to beginning of last line
ga  - Gives ASCII value of character under cursor

Power of global(g) command
------------------
:[range]g/pattern/command
- Above command acts on [range] (default - whole file), by executing 'cmd'
  command, for each line matching 'pattern'.

Examples:
:g/pattern/d
- Delete all lines matching 'pattern'

:g/pattern/z#.5
- Display context (5 lines) for all occurrences of a pattern.

:g/pattern/z#.5 | echo "==========="
- Same as above but with some beautification.

:g!/pattern/d
:v/pattern/d
- Do NOT delete lines matching 'pattern'

:g/^\s*$/d
- Delete all blank lines. '^' start of line, '\s*' is zero or more white
  spaces, '$' end of line.



http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Power_of_g

Wikia Tips
----------
1. Insert line numbers in file (not just display) or a portion of file?

    http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Insert_line_numbers

    :%s/^/\=printf("%d", line("."))   // prints current line number. Read
                                      // above link for more granularity.

Code Indentation
----------------
1. Shift+V and then up/down
2. hit =

Key Mappings
-------------
{cmd} {attr} {lhs} {rhs}

where
{cmd}  is one of ':map', ':map!', ':nmap', ':vmap', ':imap',
       <buffer>, <silent>, <expr> <script>, <unique> and
       <special>. More than one attribute can be specified to a map.
{lhs}  left hand side, is a sequence of one or more keys that are being
       mapped.
{rhs}  right hand side, is the sequence of keys that the {lhs} keys are

Ex: Map Ctrl+Tab to next tab and Ctrl+Shift+Tab to prev tab
nnoremap <C-Tab> <ESC>:tabnext<CR>
nnoremap <C-S-Tab> <ESC>:tabprevious<CR>

# Unmap arrow keys
no <up> <Nop>
no <down> <Nop>
no <left> <Nop>
no <right> <Nop>


Vim Tips from Youtube talks
---------------------------
1) Highlight 80th column

" Make the 81st column stand out with magenta color
highlight ColorColumn ctermbg=magenta
" Call ColorColumn on 81st column virtually.
call matchadd('ColorColumn', '\81xv', 100)

Completion tips (tags, file name etc):
-------
2)
ctrl+r --> insert text from a register
ctrl+a --> insert last inserted text (access . register)

ctrl+p --> Keyword completion. 'p' means, look back in the document
ctrl+n --> Keyword completion. 'n' mean next

ctrl+x --> puts you in a special X mode (submode of insert mode). This allows
           you to autocomplete tags using tags file.
ctrl+x ctrl+] --> completes a class name (and such tags) when pressed after
                   letter

3) Vim keeps track of Jump List: files that Vim jumped to.
ctrl+i, ctrl+o --> you can go in and out of that list

4) Filename completion:
ctrl+x, ctrl+f --> vim completes file names from current directory

5) Context aware completion
ctrl+x, ctrl+p or ctrl+n
ctrl+x, ctrl+l --> context aware line completion

6) Context aware Omni completion
ctrl+x, ctrl+o

7) Auto completion settings
:set complete
    complete=.,w,b,u,t,i
    . = look in current buffer
    w = look in split window buffer (adjacent window)
    b = Other buffers, this or other Vim tab
    u = look in unloaded buffer, not active in any window
    t = look in tags file
    i = look in inserted file

Vim Navigation
----
L   last line of current screen
M   middle line of current screen
^e  move the screen by one line down, with cursor staying in its place
^y  move the screen up by one line

0   beginning of the line
$   end of the line
^   first non-blank character of the line
g_  last non-blank character of the line

n%  takes you to nth percent position of the file

*   search for occurance of word under cursor
#   same as *, but move in opposite direction

Q: What is a word in Vim?
- Hyphen, Exclamation, Period delianated ... stuff?

Word wise navigation:
w   small word
W   big word
e vs E
b vs B


Vim Marks
---------
- Marks are points in file(s) that you can jump between.
- Three types of marks:
    * Lowercase marks - for points within a buffer/file.
    * Uppercase marks - for points across buffers/files.
    * Numbered marks - unmodifiable marks stored in viminfo file

- Mark can be set only in Normal mode as: m<alphabet>
    * <alphabet> can be uppper or lower case.
    * If reused, latest mark overrides previous mark.

- Jumping to a mark:
    `<alphabet>  takes you to position where mark is set
    '<alphabet>  takes you to beginning of line where mark is set

- Full power of mark is in combining them with other composable commands.


Vim Scripting Language
-------
Syntax of the Language: Verb + Noun
---
d   for delete
w   for word
combine to be "delete word"

- Commands are repeatable and undoable

Verbs in Vim
---
d   Delete
c   Change (delete and enter insert mode)
>   Indent
<   Outdent
v   Visually select
y   Yank (copy)

Nouns in Vim -- Motions
---
w   word (forward by a "word")
b   back (back by a "word")
2j  down 2 lines


Nouns in Vim -- Text Objects
---
iw      "inner word" (works from anywhere in a word)
it      "inner tag" (the contents of an HTML tag)
i"      "inner quotes"
ip      "inner paragraph"
as      "a sentence"


Nouns in Vim -- Parameterized Text Objects
---
f, F    "find" the next character
t, T    "find" the next character
/,?     Search up to next match


Tips for Mastering Vim Language
-----
- The 'dot' command should be guiding rule
- Visual mode means something is wrong


File Navigation
---
set path+=**    " recursive search all files in subdirectories
                " accepts wild chars. Works like fuzzy file search
                " Use with wildmenu

:b *file        " searches for files in buffer


Tag Jumping
----
command! MakeTags !ctags -R .

- Use ^] to jump to tag under cursor
- Use g^] for ambiguous tags
- Use ^t to jump back the tag stack

Autocomplete
----
^x^n    for just this file
^x^f    for file names
^x^]    tags only
^x^d    definition (in Vim's dictionary)
^x^i    Keywords in included files
^x^l    Lines (useful while writing Markdown)
^x^t    Thesaurus (Needs an input file)
^x^k    Dictionary
^x^s    Spelling
^x^v    Vim commands
^n      for anything specified by complete option

^n and ^p   go back and forth in suggestion list

Read docs at |ins-completion|


Intermediate Vim [5]
===
- Most commands are composed of an action and a motion
    * Actions do something
    * Motions move the cursor

- Uncommon Motions
    * Text objects: w, s, p, b, B, etc
        * Pneumonic?
            + "a word" -> aw
            + "inner block" -> ib
    * Last position in change list: g; (g, is go back)

Copy & Paste
---
- Forget Copy/Paste and think Registers
- You now have 35 copy buffers/registers
"+ is X server (i.e system) copy/paste register, copy to here to copy out of Vim
:reg    view content of registers
<C-r> in insert mode puts the register


Common Registers
---
"[1-9] history registers (or delete registers. It acts like a Queue)
"0 the yank register
"[a-z] are named registers
"[A-Z] samd as "[a-z] but append


Important Registers
---
"/  current search pattern
"-  small delete
"=  expression register
"_  the black hole register


Read-Only Registers
---
":  last :command
".  last inserted text
"%  filename of current buffer
"#  filename of alternate file (last file you edited)
:h registers

Undo and Redo Trees
---


Macros
---
- Recording a Macros starts by hitting q and then a letter, then sequence of
actions are recorded in that register.
- Hit q again to stop recording
- @<register-alphabet> will replay the macros actions


Windows
---
:h windows
- Lots of commands/help


Digraphs & Special Characters
---
- Digraphs: insert weird chars like: é,ä,etc
- In insert mode, ^k followed by one or two chars
:h digraphs


Templates
---
0r ~/path/to/template   << this puts entire template in to this file


Snippets
---
:ab list of abbreviations
- Ultisnips and Snipmate: provide better snippets support and advance features


Notes from [6, 7]
---
Vim Concepts
---
- Modal Editing: Normal, Insert, Visual, Ex (or Command) modes

Scrolling
---
^E      Scroll window down
^Y      Scroll window up
^F      Scroll down one page
^B      Scroll up one page
H       Move cursor to top of window
M       Move cursor to middle of window
L       Move cursor to bottom of window


text-objects
---
w       word
s       sentence
p       paragraph
t       tags as in XML/HTML files


Motions: Getting from a to b
---
word = Any set of alphanumeric chars. Does not include commas, period etc
WORD - Chars separated by whitespace (or the like)

Basics: wWbBeE
w       Forward to beginning of next word
W       Forward to beginning of next WORD

[n]F<o>     Backward until (nth) (o) Inclusive
[n]t<o>     Forward until (nth) (o) Exclusive
[n]T<o>     Backward until (nth) (o) Exclusive


Searching

?   Backward
*   Word under cursor - Forward search (bounded)
g*  Word under cursor - Forward search (unbounded)
#   Word under cursor - Backward search (bounded)
g#  Word under cursor - Backward search (unbounded)

Motions
---
a       all
i       in
t       until
f       find

// repeat what they do

diw
daw
ca[     change everything including []
ci]     change everything inside []
ca      << there's space after 'a'
va"     visually select everything including "

s   Delete char under cursor and enter insert mode
S   Delete line and insert mode at beginning of same line
a   Enter insert mode _after_ cursor
A   Enter insert mode at end of line
o   Enter insert mode on next line
O   Enter insert mode above line
C   Delete from cursor to end of line and enter insert mode


==========   Ten Things You Don't Know About Vim [8]    ====================
In .vimrc, do following
set nocompatible    " not compatible with vi
filetype off

1) Help System. Very extensive
:help i_CTRL-V      " tells what CTRL-V does in insert mode
:help :help         " help about help
:help text-objects  " help about concepts 'text-objects'
:help gU            " help about key strokes
:help 'compatible'  " options
:help submatch()    " Vimscript functions
:help surround      " help about plugins after installing

- Vim is Upside-Down vs GUI editor. In Vim, action comes first and object next
    * [number]<verb><object> or [number]<verb><adverb><object>
    * Ex: diw, yw, c$

- Visual Mode is somewhat similar to GUI
    * Select object first and perform operation.

- Example. verb -> gU (change to Uppercase)
           object -> char, word or line

2) Visual Block Mode
- CTRL-V puts vim into Visual Block mode


3) Text-Object
- aw or iw: around word, inner word
- All text-objects start with a (around) or i (inner)
- Around includes whitespace or things like that with object of your interest
- Inner is just the object
- word, sentence (ending with .), paragraph

4) Registers
- Put something in a register
    "<alphabet><operation>
- Play something from a register
    @<register>

5) Macros
- Record operations in to a register and repeatedly apply them
q 	start recording
a	record in to register a
<do your operations>
q	end recording

- But typing entire operation on a line and saving them into a register is more
  convenient.

- Suppose, at 36.48 in [1], user has list of names. He want's to number them and
  add ; at the end. They can type this on a line

A; I =b:i
)  l~j:let b:i+=1

6) Shell output in to Vim directly
:4,8!<shell cmd>
- Result of shell command is pasted in lines 4,8

7) Advanced search & replace
set hlsearch    " highlight search
set incsearch   " find as you type

- Search history by q/


8) Regular Exp in search
- Vim's regex is very bad
- Instead use "magic v"

/\v<regex>
- Now regex behaves like Perl regex

9) Browse vimrc session from within vim and live update settings and save it
using :mksession <session-name>.vim

- Later on, load that session using :source <session-name>.vim

10) Open an HTTPS file using :edit https://github.com/umbs/dotfiles/blob/master/vimrc

11) You can edit a tar.gz file "live" from within Vim

================   Autocompletion in Vim    ==============
by Stephen Belcher

- Works in 'Insert' mode
- Ctrl-X puts you in special mode and then a command
    * Line completion (Ctrl-l)
    * File keywords (Ctrl-n/Ctrl-p)
    * Keywords in included files (Ctrl-i)
    * Dictionary Words (Ctrl-k)
    * Thesaurus Words (Ctrl-t)
    * Filenames (Ctrl-f)
    * Definitions/Macros (Ctrl-d)   // C and C++ languages
    * Vim command-line (Ctrl-v)
    * User-defined functions (Ctrl-u). These functions are custom
      auto-completion
    * Omni Completion (Ctrl-o)

- Use :pclose after Omni Completion suggestions

- :help ins-complete

================   Registers in Vim    ==============
by Stephen Belcher

- Like clipboard, but there are many of them
- Persists between sessions
    * Saved in .viminfo
    * Read .viminfo, there'll be lot of useful info from previous Vim sessions

- Registers are (almost) always prefixed with "
    * Only scripts or macros prefix them with @

- To write in to register 'r', do the following
    "rdd    // dd is for write to

- To read from register 'e', do the following
    "ep     // p is for paste

- Vim doc breaks registers in to 10 groups

""  This is unnamed register. Any delete/change/x/s operation will put that text
in to "" register and then to named register if provided.

"0  Default destination for yanked text unless another register is provided like
this "ay. Now, text is copied to "a register and unnamed register :)

If you yank to unnamed register (""y) then a copy is made in "0 register. Vim
probably wants to maintain two copies

"1 thru "9 default destination for any multi-line deleted text

"1 is written on every delete, unless another register is specified ("bd4j)

Before delete in to "1, current contents of "1 are moved to "2, "2 to "3 and so
on. Contents of "9 fall off.

"-  deletions that are small (less than one line x, dw etc)

"a to "z. Only written to/read from when specifically asked.

"A thru "Z behave differently to "a thru "z
    * "add overwrites the "a register
    * "Add appends to "a register
    * Useful when u want to append non-contiguous lines

:help registers

:let @x = "value"   This will manually set contents of x register

================   Macros in Vim    ==============
by Stephen Belcher

Definition: Recorded series of commands that can easily be replayed again and
again

Recursive Macros: A macro which calls itself, so that the macro automatically
repeats until it's finished

Recording Macros:
    * In NORMAL mode, press q and then any letter (example: qe). This is the
      register where macro is recorded
    * Follow with sequence of commands
    * Return to NORMAL mode and press q to stop recording

Playing Macros:
    * In NORMAL mode, press @, then the letter of register (example: @e)
    * This replays macros stored in register "e
    * Macro replay will stop when finished or hit an error

Viewing Macros:
    * In NORMAL mode, just do "<register-alphabet> where macro is registered
    * :registers
    * :registers "e

Editing Macros:
- You can copy contents of a Macro to file like this: "ep
- Edit the contents
- Copy them back to the register as: "edaW

    "e  -> In to register e
    d   -> delete
    a   ->
    W   -> Big word

More Macro Concepts:
- Macros are transactional
    * Entire actions of macros can be undone using 'u'
    * What happens if macro opens new file. Can you undo it?

- Macros can be repeated by pressing @@ in NORMAL mode
    * Think like @@ is special macro-specific register containing last executed
      macro

- Like any regular macro, they have command to execute themselves
    * Example: cw<REDACTED>^[n@e
    * The last @e makes it recursive macro

- Recursive Macros continue until they hit error condition


Creating Recursive Macros

Option 1:
    * Empty a macro register (qeq)
    * Record macro, including execution of current macro (@e) at the end

Option 2:
    * Record macro as usual (Example: qe ... q)
    * Append a macro execution via special upper-case register. So, have @e in
      your file, have cursor on @ and do this "E2x
    * Since upper-case registers are append only, they'll append @e to the "E
      register

Option 3:
    * Record macro as usual (Example: qe ... q)
    * In command-line mode, run following Vimscript command
        :let @e = @e . '@e'

====================== Vimscript (Talk by Prabir Shresta)  ========================
:help variables
    string          Job
    number          Channel
    float           Blob
    null
    dictionary
    list
    funcref

let string = "help"
let number = 1
let float = 1.0
let list = [1, 2, "hello", "world"]
let dictionary = {"message": "hello world"}


- Multiline statement
    let list = [
        \ 1, 2,
        \ "hello",
        \ "world" ]

- Some quirks. Comments cannot be inline in a multiline code. Example of multi
  line code

- Special Variables
    let t = v:true
    let f = v:false
    let n = v:null
    " All variables starting with v:<something> are read only.

- Variable Scoping

  	let g:global_var = "global variable accessible across all script"
	let s:script_var = "script level variable accessible across the entire script/file"
    let l:local_var = "local variable accessible only in the scope"
    let b:buffer_var = "buffer scope"
    let w:window_var = "window scope"
    let t:tab_var = "tab scope"

====================== Vimscript (Steve Losh)  ========================
- On Linux and Mac OSX, ~/.vimrc and Windows ~/_vimrc
- :echo $MYVIMRC, tells where this file is on any OS

Persistent Echoing
---
  :echo "Hello World"
  :echom "Hello World, Again"   <<< persistent and shown in :messages
  :messages

Options
===

Boolean Options
---
  :set <option>     " :set number
  :set <nooption>   " :set nonumber
  :set <option>!    " :set number!  Toggles the option
  :set <option>?    " :set number?  Find settings


Option with Value
---
  :set <option>=<value>     " :set numberwidth=4
  :set <option>?            " :set numberwidth?


  :setlocal <option>=<value>    " set only for local buffer
  " Not all options can be used with 'setlocal'. Read it's :help for details.

Basic Mappings
---
    :map <lhs> <rhs>

<lhs>   This could be basic chars or special chars like <space> or <c-d>
<rhs>   Group of commands that'll be run

- Modal Mapping: nmap, vmap, imap
- Each of *map has a *noremap counterpart
    map, noremap
    nmap, nnoremap
    vmap, vnoremap
    imap, inoremap


Leader Key: Vim let's you set any key as leader as follows:
---
    :let mapleader = "-"    " - is leader key

<leader> means, whatever I have my leader key set to.

- Why do you need <leader> key at all?
    * Easy to change <leader> mapping.
    * Other's can understand what <leader> means and can copy your .vimrc file.
    * Many plugins use <leader> key in their mappings. Easy for you to use them.

:nnoremap          <leader>d dd     " mapping applies to all buffers
:nnoremap <buffer> <leader>x dd     " mapping applies to current buffer.

- Instead of <buffer> in mappings, <localleader> is recommended.

Local Leader Key: Used for mappings on specific file types (Python, HTML etc)
---
    :let maplocalleader = "\\"      " \ is escape char in Vimscript. Must use \\



Abbreviations
---
- Very similar to mappings, but done in insert, replace and command modes.
- Usually done for spelling corrections. For insert mode,
    :iabbrev adn and
    :iabbrev waht what
    :iabbrev tehn then

- Vim substitutes an abbreviation when you type "non-keyword character" after an
  abbreviation.

- What is "non-keyword character"?
    * :set iskeyword?
    * It's complicated. Read here :help isfname (too complicated)
    * https://learnvimscriptthehardway.stevelosh.com/chapters/08.html
    * Assume that abbrev expands when you type anything other than letter,
      underscore or number

- Difference between Mappings and Abbreviations
    * Mappings don't take in to account chars before and after the map.
    * Abbreviations. Vim pays more attention to chars before and after.

Autocommands: a way to tell Vim to run certain commands whenever certain events
happen.
---
- Syntax
    autocmd [group] {events} {file_pattern} [nested] {command}

- Ex:

:autocmd BufNewFile * :write
         ^          ^ ^
         |          | |
         |          | The command to run.
         |          |
         |          A "pattern" to filter the event.
         |
         The "event" to watch for.


- :help autocmd-events

- Autocommands offer many events to watch.


Examples:
" Save (Write to disk) a buffer whenever it is new and opened
:autocmd BufNewFile * :write

" Same as above, but only to files with .txt extension
:autocmd BufNewFile *.txt :write


" Just before saving html file, reindent
:autocmd BufWritePre *.html :normal gg=G


" Multiple events. Same as above, but while reading too.
:autocmd BufWritePre,BufRead *.html :normal gg=G

" When you read or open a new html file, don't wrap lines.
:autocmd BufNewFile,BufRead *.html setlocal nowrap



FileType Events
---
" Comment out an entire line in Javascript file when you do <localleader>c
:autocmd FileType javascript nnoremap <buffer> <localleader>c I//<esc>

" Comment out an entire line in Python file when you do <localleader>c
:autocmd FileType python     nnoremap <buffer> <localleader>c I#<esc>


Autocommands and Abbreviations
---
- Pair up Autocommands and buffer-local abbreviations to form our own snippet
  system.

    :autocmd FileType python    :iabbrev <buffer> iff if:<left>


Autocommand Groups: Read LVSHW for details.
    :help autocmd-groups

- When you create same autocmd multiple times, Vim does not override
  earlier one.
- Problem compounds if you have autocmd in your .vimrc and each time you source
  it, duplicate autocmds get created.

- The extra space is not required. Done only for readability.

:augroup testgroup
:    autocmd BufWrite * :echom "Foo"
:    autocmd BufWrite * :echom "Bar"
:augroup END

- When you use augroup multiple times, Vim "combines" them. Does union of
  autocmds.
- If you don't want union and want to clear a group, use 'autocmd!' at the
  start.

:augroup testgroup
:    autocmd!
:    autocmd BufWrite * :echom "Cats"
:augroup END

Navigating Neovim Terminals

- See `:help terminal-emulator` for more info
- Ways to spawn a terminal
    :terminal
    :term://bash    spawns bash terminal
    :term://zsh     spawns zsh terminal
    :term://htop    runs htop in new term
    :vsplit term://zsh
    :split term://bash


- Ctrl+\ Ctrl+n puts you in 'normal' mode. After that, it is like navigating
  another window in Vim.

- Navigating between windows is only possible in Normal Mode.

Up and Running with Neovim + LSP
- There is native support for LSP in Neovim. But nvim-lspconfig makes it *easy*
  to setup the LSP config
- Understood plugin files are laid out, especially making use of Lau support in
  Neovim.

- Installation of LSP plugin
    Plug 'neovim/nvim-lspconfig'
- Note that `nvim-lspconfig` is NOT a client. With plugin, it is easy to
  configure LSP client to talk to LSP server, manage it etc.

- You can setup the config in `init.vim` like this
    lua << EOF
    require'lspconfig'.pyright.setup{}
    EOF

    OR, just this in `lua` folder inside .config/nvim/lua/
    require'lspconfig'.pyright.setup{}

- Lots of info about `lua` directory and namespace directory inside that
  directory. This is best practice [3]
- For every plugin, create a .lua file in this namespace folder
- Read up [2] for more details

- Discussions on root_dir for LSP to know where to start. Each server has their
  way. Read up on pyright's configurations [4]

- on_attach function during setup of LSP server. Watch at this timestamp [5] and
  look for configuration at [6]
