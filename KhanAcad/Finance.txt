                PERSONAL FINANCE PLAYLIST 
                =========================

Vid 1: What it means to buy a company's stock
-----
- Equity = (Assets - Liabilities) 
- Theoretically, value of one share = Equity/Number of shares. 
- If share price is greater than above theoretical value then people
  expect the company to do well. If its lower, people expect it to do
  badly?? 

- Current Assets = Value that can be 'converted' to cash/money in next one
  year. 
- Current Liabilities = Money owed/debt to be payed in next one year. 

Vid 2: Primer on unemployment rate
-----
- Total US population ~300M 
- Total US population > 16 or more years of age (employable age) ~237M 
- Actual Labor Force = Working population 
                             + 
                       Actively looking for work population
                     ~155M 
- Unemployed People = Unemployed + Actively looking for work ~5M 
- Unemployment Rate = (Unemployed People)/(Actual Labor Force) * 100 
                    = (5M)/(155M)*100 
                    = ~9.7%

- Does not account people entering and exiting labor force which can
  drastically affect the unemployment rate. 


Vid 3: Traditional IRA (Individual Retirement Account)  
-------
- Each individual can invest up to certain limit each year based on age.
  This limit is set by IRA and is usually high for people older than 50
  yrs. 
- The money contributed to IRA is pre-taxed and will be taxed only when
  taking it out. 
- There is a penalty of 10% for early withdrawl of IRA money. Cut off date
  is 59.5yrs. 


Case Study: 
----- 
An individual with income in 32% tax bracket contributs $5000 to IRA. How
does he fare contributing (& investing) through IRA versus investing by
himself (without IRA). 

                                IRA                     No IRA 
                             ---------               ------------
Starting Amount                $5000                $5000 * 32% = $3400

Invest in stock A
for 10yrs and amount 
doubles                       $10,000                 $6800

After tax, amount left        $10,000               $6800 - ($3400*15%)
                           (won't pay tax           = $6290
                           because money is        (15% tax on $3400
                           still with IRA)           capital gains)  

Invest in stock B 
for 10yrs and amount 
doubles                       $20,000                  $12,580 


After tax, amount left        $20,000             $12,580 - ($6290*15%) 
                                                  = $11,636.50 

If you are over 59.5yrs 
now and eligible to 
withdraw. Say you earn 
much less now and fall 
in 25% tax bracket

------------------------------------------------------------------------
After tax, amount left        $15,000                 $11,636.50 
------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is made up scenario and most likely/probable one. 


Vid 4: The rule of 72 for compound interest 
---------
- A simple rule to describe how long does it take for a principal amount
to double, given an interest rate R%: 72/R 
        Ex: R = 10% per annum. 
            It takes 7.2yrs to double the principal amount. 

            R = 10% per month. 
            It takes 7.2months to double. 

- Actual formula: 
        Let P0 = principal amount right now. 
        Let P1 = Total amount after 1 year. 
        Let Pn = Total amount after n years. 
        Let R  = Interest rate per year. 

        Pn = P0 + P1 + P2 + ... 
           = P0(1+R/100)^n 


Vid 5: Term and Whole Life Insurance Policies
--------- 
- Term Insurace: Policy on life for a certain term (say 10yrs). 
        - Pay yearly premium of, say, $500 for 10yrs for a payoff to
          beneficiary upon death within 10yrs. 
        - If no death then you loose whole money. 
        - If the term length is longer, premiums are higher due to higher
          probability of death. 
        - Premiums go up with age. 
        - This plan is not available after a certain age (like 70yrs or
          so). 

- Life Insurace: Policy taken out for the whole life. 
        - Premiums are much higher than Term Insurance. 
        - Payout is after death to beneficiary. 
        - Optional savings plan associated with Life Insurance where a
          certain % interest is given on your premium. 
        - If you opt out of LI policy before death, you can take out the
          savings at a certain fee. 
        - However, upon death, only the Insurance payout will be provided
          to beneficiary. The cash savings is lost and will not be paid to
          beneficiary. 


Vid 6: Roth IRA
----------
- Named after William Roth, Delaware Senator who proposed this bill. 
- Roth IRA is post tax investment. 
- Principal can be withdrawn anytime without penalty. 
- If more than principal is withdrawn (if principal increases) then 10%
penalty and income tax is applied. 
- After 59.5yrs, only income tax is applied on amount (except principal).  




                        Traditional IRA         Roth IRA 
                        --------------------------------
Initial: $5000             $5000               $3400 (at 32% tax)         
deposit                (tax deferred) 

Investment doubles         $10000              $6800 
but stays in IRA 

Investment doubles         $20000              $13600 
again but stays in IRA

Ex 1: 
Withdraw $3400 before   $3400-($340 penalty)    $3400-(1088 at 32% tax)
59.5yrs                 - ($1088 at 32% tax)    = $2312
                        = $1972

Ex 2: 
Withdraw $4000 before   $4000-($400 penalty)    No tax on $3400. 
59.5yrs                 -($1280 at 32% tax)     On $600, 10% penalty +  
                        = $2320                 32% income tax = $348 
                                                Total = $3748. 

Ex 3: 
Withdraw after 59.5yrs  $15000                  No tax on $3400 + 
at 25% tax rate         (after tax)             25% on $10200 
                                                = $11050



Vid 8: Personal Bankruptcy - Chapters 7 and 13 
------
- Defaulting on debt and a legal process to handle that is defined in
  Bankruptcy laws. Chapt 7 & 13 are the most common and applies to
  individuals.

- Mideval times, if one fails to repay the debt, there was a concept of
  'debt labor' - repaying in form of labor. 
- In early 18th century, there were debt prisons. Charles Dicken's dad was
  in debt prison. Family has to repay the loan/debt and free the debtor.  

Chapt 7: 
-------
- Chap 7 is a stronger, straight forward declaration of Bankruptcy. 
- You go to bankruptcy court and declare it. They appoint an assessor, who
  takes all your assets, within reasonable limits, sell it off and pay the
  creditors. 
- This stays on credit report for 10 yrs.  


Chapt 13: 
-----
- Much lenient than Chap 7, this is asking court to reduce the interest
  rates, or debt amount or some thing similar. It is still promising to
  return the debt, but negotiating the terms & conditions. 
- This also stays on credit report for 10 yrs. 


- Other chapters of Bankruptcy law deals with other types of situations:
  Chapter 12 is related to food producers (farmers, fisher men etc);
  Chapter 11 is related to insitutions, but some individuals with vast
  assets can also fall in this category.  

- Certain loans/debts cannot be waived under Bankruptcy laws. Student loan
  is one.


Vid 9: Open Ended Mutual Funds
-------
- Imagine someone wants to start an investment fund, they go to SEC,
  incorporate themselves and start soliciting funds from public. They have
  to pass all regulatory hurdles first. 
- Hedge Funds cannot solicit funds from general public. 

- Suppose, we start a fund with $400 investment and 4 shares. So, Total
  Assets Under Management (AUM) is $400. 
- If someone wants to invest, fund can issue new shares at $100 each. Let
  say, new AUM is $500 (total 5 shares).
- The Net Asset Value (NAV) is $100/share. 
- If fund performs well and grows to $1000, the new NAV is $200. 
- If someone wants 10 new shares, the fund manager can create new ones and
  issue them, making AUM to $2000. 
- If a particular year, fund looses 10%, AUM is now $1800. 
- If one investor wants his money back, the fund AUM reduces to $1620.
  Note that NAV still remains same, $180. 
- Drawback of Open Ended MF is that manager has to have some cash reserve
  to return investors (typically 3-5%) 
- OEMF can grow or shrink frequently (without affective NAV in above
  example).


Vid 10: Intro to Mortgage Loans
---------

Vid 11: Intro to Compound Interest  
---------




Vid 12: Intro to Bonds
---------
- Companies or Govt or any institutions can raise funds in two ways: 
  (a) Borrow from a bank (b) Issue bonds

- In the case of bonds (from what I understand), there are a lot many
  investors and hence distributing the risk. Compare this to a bank
  lending the entire sum. If the institution defaults, the bank bears a
  heavy loss. 

- Similar to a loan, in Bonds, there is a Maturity Date, Interest Rate and
  Coupons (dates when the interest on principal is disbursed). 
- Typically, interests are payed semi-annually. 

- Ex: If a Company wants to raise $5M capital, they can issue 5000 bonds
  at $1000 face value (par value), at an interest rate of 10% and 2yr
  maturity. This is how the bond pays out. 

  -------------+--------------+---------------+------------------+
  0           6m             12m             18m                24m
  -$1000     +$50            +50            +$50              +$50
                                                              +$1000 

- From Company's perpective: 

        Initial Asset 
        +---------+
        | $10M    |
        +---------+

        After issuing bonds
           Asset    Debt/Liabilities 
        +---------+---------+
        | $10M    |  $5M    |
        +---------+---------+

        If Company's assets grow to, say, $20M, bond holders DO NOT
        benefit. They only get what's promised to them. 



Vid 13: Institutional roles in issuing and processing credit cards  
---------

Vid 14: Basics of Estate Tax 
---------
+ Also called inheritence tax. 
+ No tax up to $5M. But taxed 10% on anything above. 
+ This tax is when estate is inherited from an individual. But when
inherited from joint (couple), its a different rate. 

Vid 15: Basics of US income tax rate
------

Vid 16: APR and Effective APR 
-------
+ Credit Cards announce an APR value (say, 22%) and in fine print mention
a daily interest rate of 0.06027% (=22/365)
+ However, if we compound this interest, the effective APR =
(1.0006027)^365 ~ 24.59%
+ Note that due to compounding, the effective interest is a bit higher. 


Vid 17: 401K 
--------
+ Similar to Traditional IRA. 
+ Differences: 
        - Larger limit to invest in 401K.  
        - In 401K Company matches and theoretically, a generous employer
          can match a lot of money. There is a limit of combined
          contribution of $50K. 
        - Traditional IRA give flexibility to invest anywhere. 401K is
          tied to options given by employer.
        - Not so important, in 401K, the money is automatically deducted
          from paycheck while in Traditional IRA, we have to invest after
          receiving the paycheck. Tax deductions happens at end of the
          year.
