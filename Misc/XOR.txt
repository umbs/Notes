Insights in to XOR operations 

If A, B, C are boolean values: 

A ^ B = ?? (True if only one is True)  
A ^ B ^ C = ?? (True if odd number of them are True) 

Observations: 
+ Results in True if Odd number of boolean's are True.  
+ Its binary addition without bit carry (0+0=0, 0+1=1+0=1, 1+1=0). 
+ Flips 1 bit.
