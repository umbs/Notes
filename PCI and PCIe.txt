                  PCI        AND         PCIe 
                  ===========================

DEFINITION:
-----------
Peripheral Component Interconnect [PCI] is a protocol to connect
peripheral devices such as sound, video and NICs to motherboard. It is
32-bits in size and can handle up to 5 devices. This is a drawback.

PCIe eliminates these shortcomings. It provides 64-bit width and is much
faster than PCI.
