CLOS Networks [1]
------------
+ An old design (from 1950's) proposed by Charles Clos. 
+ CLOS netwok proposes a mesh connection between telephone switches. It's also
called crossbar switch (or topology). 
+ This topology looks like threads in a cloth fabric and hence the name switch
*fabric*. 



+ This design again picked up interest and implemented in Ethernet switches,
between interfaces. If not properly implemented, Head Of Line [2] problem can
surface. 
+ As switching fabric technologies evolved, this problem is now academic.
+ Also, networks moved away from CLOS to Fat Tree [3] model.  

+ Fat Tree model uses a progressively higher bandwidth when moving from leaf to
root of a tree. This removed problems faced in other network topology models
such as mesh (CLOS) and Hypercubes [4].  
+ Some problems with networks built using STP (and hence a Fat Tree) is that a
SINGLE best path is chosen from many alternatives. Alternatives sit idle, until
best path becomes congested and packets drop. 
+ ECMP (Equal Cost Multi Path) routing allows using multiple best path with loop
free Fat Trees.   

+ TRILL (Transparent Interconnect of Lots of Links) allows multipath, similar to
ECMP and removes need for STP. It is an L2 protocol on top of L3 and tries to
create a flat network (loop free).  

+ CLOS design reappeared in Data Center networks, between leaf and spine
switches. For L leaf and S spine switches, there will be LxS connections. 

+ Cisco's version of TRILL is called FabricPath protocol 
+ Juniper's version is QFabric System. It is based on IS-IS protocol and not
TRILL. 
+ Brocade has Virtual Cluster Switching (VCS) Fabric, which is a TRILL
implementation. 
+ Arista uses a new architecture called Spline, which is a collapsed leaf and
spline architecture.
