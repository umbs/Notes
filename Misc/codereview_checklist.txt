                       Checklist for C Codereview 
                       --------------------------
NOTE: This list is prepared mostly from personal experience. 

Function Arguments: 
----------------
- Check if right values are passed as func args, especially, if these args
  are pointers and are dereferrenced inside the routine. (Static code
  analysis tools can do this check too). 

 
Function Return Type:
--------------------- 
- Examine what values are being returned. And if those values are handled
  properly by calling function.

Copying Objects: 
---------------
-  When an object (or a data structure) is copied to another object using
   memcpy, What is the intent? 
     (a) Copy all attributes of the object? 
     (b) Copy only some?
   If its (a), what happens if only some attributes are changed (Eg.,
   update of a profile) and rest remain same? Will the old attributes get
   copied? 

Deleting configs: 
-----------------
- In case of profiles on a ccts, what SHOULD happen when they are deleted?
  Should attributes take default value? Should they take some other value? 

Read/Write to Event Queues:
---------------------------
- If multiple threads are writing to an event queue (producers), they should
  not be setting flags (or values in shared data) indicating that 'event has
  been consumed'. Only the consumer of the event should do that job. Of
  course, producers can set flags to the effect 'event has been produced',
  but not 'event has been consumed'.
