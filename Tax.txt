********************* HSA (Health Savings Account) **********************

How does my HSA affect my taxes?

    A Health Savings Account (HSA) is a tax-exempt account you can use to pay
    for qualified medical expenses.

    You or your employer can contribute money to your HSA. Contributions made by
    your employer are considered  “pre-tax contributions” and are typically
    reported in box 12 of your W-2 with code W. These contributions aren’t
    taxable because they aren’t considered income. They’re also not deductible
    for the same reason.

    When you (not your employer) make contributions to your HSA, they can be
    deductible and may lower the amount of income you’ll pay taxes on.

What if my employer contributed to my HSA?

    If your employer contributes to your HSA, those contributions are pre-tax,
    which means you won’t pay tax on them. You can't deduct those contributions
    on your taxes because they weren’t included in your income.

    If your HSA contributions weren't included in Box 12 of your W-2, those
    amounts are deductible because you paid tax on those contributions (there
    are limits, and we'll be sure to check on those). These contributions lower
    your overall taxable income at the end of the year, which means you get
    taxed on less income.

Why is it called 'employer-contributed' when the contributions are deducted from
my salary?

    When an amount in box 12 is coded with a W, it represents the total amount
    of pre-tax contributions to your HSA. Whether it was you, your employer, or
    both of you who contributed funds into your HSA account, the combined amount
    goes into this box.

    We know it's kind of tricky since it says 'Employer contributions', but that
    box generally contains the full amount of pre-tax contributions to your HSA,
    including amounts you elected to contribute.
