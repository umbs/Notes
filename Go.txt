***********************   Test With Go (Jon Calhoun) **********************
CHAPTER: Naming Conventions
----------


File Naming Conventions: Usually, the convention is as follows:
-----
    math.go
    math_test.go

- `export_test.go`: access unexported variables in external tests.
- `xxx_internal_test.go`: for internal tests.
- `example_xxx_test.go`: for examples in isolated files.

Function Naming Conventions:
-----
- Typically:
    func TestXXX(t *testing.T) {
    }

- How to write test case for following code

    import "fmt"

    type Dog struct {
        Name    string
        Age     int
    }

    func (d Dog) Bark(muzzled bool) {
        if muzzled {
            fmt.Println("woof")
        } else {
            fmt.Println("WOOF!!")
        }
    }


    func TestDog_Bark(t *testing.T) {
        ...
    }

    func TestDog_Bark_muzzled(t *testing.T) {
        ...
    }

    func TestDog_Bark_unmuzzled(t *testing.T) {
        ...
    }

    etc

Variable Naming Conventions:
-----
- Use `want` and `got`. By far mostly used.
- Some people use `actual` and `expected`






CHAPTER: Ways to signal test failure
---------
- Log()/Logf() is similar to Print()/Printf(). They only show up if Test fails or Verbose flag is passed (-v).
- Fail() will mark test as failed but continue running till end of the test.
- FailNow() will mark test as failed and aborts immediately.


    Error() = Log() + Fail()
    Errorf() = Logf() + Fail()
    Fatal() = Log() + FailNow()
    Fatalf() = Logf() + FailNow()

- If you want to keep running the test, use Error()/Errorf()
- If you want to stop the test, use Fatal()/Fatalf()


- Suggested failure message convention
    t.Errorf("SomeFunc(%v) err = %v; want %v", args, error, want)





CHAPTER: Examples as Test Cases
--------
- Example code can be used for both UT and Documentation.
- It is written just like a test case, without input argument.

- So, how is this written?

    func Hello(name string) string {
        return fmt.Sprintf("Hello %s", name)
    }

    // This naming convention is MUST
    func ExampleHello() {
        greeting := Hello("Bhaskar")
        fmt.Println(greeting)

        // Output: Hello Bhaskar
    }

    - Run `go test`, just like any other test.
    - For documentation, run `godoc -http=:3000` and go to `localhost:3000` in the browswer to view docs.



Testing unordered example output
-----
- How to test output that is not gauranteed to be in any order, like a range over maps?

    func Page(checkIns map[string]bool) {
        for name, checkIn := range checkIns {
            if !checkIn {
                fmt.Printf("Paging %s; please see the front desk to check in.\n", name)
            }
        }
    }

    func ExamplePage() {
        checkIns := map[string]bool {
            "Bob":      true,
            "Alice":    false,
            "Eve":      false,
            "Janet":    true,
            "Susan":    true,
            "John":     false,
        }
        Page(checkIns)

        // MUST put 'Unordered output' instead of just 'Output' to solve this

        // Unordered output:
        // Paging Alice; please see the front desk to check in.
        // Paging Eve; please see the front desk to check in.
        // Paging John; please see the front desk to check in.
    }


Complex Examples
------
- Lot of good things in this video
    https://courses.calhoun.io/lessons/les_twg_les_16

- In output of `godoc`, the Example() code does not show `import` statements.
  It only shows code inside `Example()` function. What to do?
    - Have single example file like `example_xxx_test.go`
    - declare an unused variable at the beginning and only then imports show up
      in the `godoc`

- Watch the video. It is very good.





CHAPTER: Testing Multiple Cases
-------------
- Table Driven Tests is a design pattern. Look at 'underscore' directory in Jon
  Calhoun github repo.
- Subtests are whenever we call tt.Run() method.
- Shared setup and teardown.
- Look at 'users' directory to setup DB and teardown after tests.
    - Very good example of test setup and teardown.

- TestMain()
    - Called before all other tests.

    func TestMain(m *testing.M) {
        // 0. flag.Parse() if you need flags
        // 1. Setup anything you need
        // 2. explicitly run your tests from here
            exitCode := m.Run()

        // 3. Call Exit with same exitCode. os.Exit() when called, stops the
        // program immediately. It does not run `defer` functions.
            os.Exit(exitCode)

    }



CHAPTER: Parallel Tests
--------------
- 'parallel' package has all code in 'twg' repo.
- All tests that have following is put in a queue to run tests in Parallel
    t.Parallel()

- Advise:
    - Run tests in Parallel only to test parallelism which happens in real world scenario.
    - DO NOT RUN IT for speed boost. When/If you see issues in your tests,
      fixing it takes LOT of time that it'll be net negative in the end.
    - Use it when there's clear reason to use it.

- Setup and Tear Down
    - To have parallel subtests obey setup and teardown behavior, you have to
      wrap all subtests in another t.Run()


- Closure Gotcha's

    func TestGotcha(t *testing.T) {
        for i := 0; i < 10; i++  {
            t.Run(fmt.Sprintf("i=%d", i), func(t *testing.T) {
                t.Parallel()
                t.Logf("Testing with i=%d", i)      <<<<< this is not accessible within subtest.
            })
        }
    }
    - Watch the video. Very insightful.


CHAPTER: Testing Race Conditions
--------------
TODO. Come back later and watch this.




CHAPTER: Comparing Objects for Equality
--------------
- 'compare' directory
- Read this:
    https://golang.org/ref/spec#Comparison_operators

- 'reflect' package is used.
    - reflect.DeepEquals()
    - Can compare Slices, Maps etc.
    - https://golang.org/pkg/reflect/#DeepEqual
    - People have different opinions about 'reflect' package.


Golden Files
---
- "Golden Files" are files that are desired output.
- They are used when we have to compare large files (csv, images, etc) in test
  cases.
- Typically, "Golden Files" are saved in same directory as tests.


Helper Comparison Functions
---
- TODO

CHAPTER: Mocks, Stubs, and Fakes
--------------
- Third Party Packages
    - github.com/josharian/impl
    - github.com/golang/mock
    - github.com/matryer/moq

    - In Go, you really don't need third party packages. Just providing an
      implementation to an interface is enough.

Faking APIs
---
- API calls go through, but they go to *your* endpoint and returns responses
  *you* defined for testing.

go build:
    - Compiles code and moves executable to GOPATH/bin/<executable>. Discards
      the packages.

go get:
    - Flags:
        - Use -x flag for details when command runs.
        - Use -d flag to only download repos and packages but not compile them.
        - Use -u flag to update packages and their dependencies.

    - Read this. Very good resource.
        - https://github.com/NanXiao/golang-101-hacks/blob/master/posts/go-get-command.md

go install:
    - Compiles code and moves the executable to $GOPATH/bin and installs all non-main
      packages in $GOPATH/pkg.
    - The cache will be used during the next compilation provided the source
      did not change yet.

    - Read this to understand differences between `go build` and `go install`
        - https://github.com/NanXiao/golang-101-hacks/blob/master/posts/go-build-vs-go-install.md

go run:
    - Compiles and runs the program.

********   Go Testing By Example (Russ Cox GopherCon Australia 2023)    *******

Tip #1: Make it easy to add new test cases.
Tip #2: Use test coverage to add new tests.
    $ go test -coverprofile=c.out
    $ go tool cover -html=c.out
Tip #3: Coverage is no substitute for thought.
Tip #4: Write exhaustive tests.
Tip #5: Separate test cases from test logic.
Tip #6: Look for special cases.
Tip #7: If you didn't add a test, you didn't fix the bug.
    - Look at
        - go/src/fmt/fmt_test.go

Tip #8: Not every test fits in a table.
    - Look at
        - go/src/strconv/fp_test.go
        - go/src/strconv/testdata/testfp.txt

Tip #9: Test cases can be in testdata files.
    - Tests don't have to be in source code.
    - Look at
        - go/src/regexp/testdata/basic.dat
    -  Another way to store test cases in files is to have pairs of files.
       "File Driven" testing. One for input and one for output.
            - go/src/cmd/internal/test2json/testdata
                - ascii.json; ascii.test
                - bench.json; bench.test
                - issue23036.json; issue23036.test
                - ...

Tip #10: Compare against other implementations

Tip #11: Make test failures readable.
Tip #12: If the answers can change, write code to update them.
    - Not sure I understood.

Tip #13: Use txtar for multi-file test cases.
    - import "golang.org/x/tools/txtar"

Tip #14:
Tip #15:

Tip #16: Code quality is limited by test quality.
    - Watch the video ... it brings ideas from earlier tips and shows how UTs
      were written for `go` command.

Tip #17: Scripts make good test cases.
Tip #18: Try rsc.io/script for your own script based test cases.

Tip #19:
Tip #20:

***********************   Notes from `Go by Example`   **********************
    1. Values
            - string, integers, boolean, flots, structs (user defined)
            - strings can be added with +

    2. Variables
            - `var` declares one or more variables with the type specified at the end
            - Go can infer type from initialized value
            - Walrus operator ( := ) declares and initializes variables

    3. Constants
            - Can be used where `var` is used.

    4. For
            - Only loop in Go.

    5. If/Else
            - Like `for`, this has no braces.

    6. Switch
        -

    7. Arrays

    8. Slices

    9. Maps
    10. Range
    11. Functions
    12. Multiple Return Values
    13. Variadic Functions
    14. Closures
    15. Recursion
    16. Pointers
    17a. Strings
            - read-only slice of bytes. The language and the standard library treat
              strings specially - as containers of text encoded in UTF-8.
            - strings are equivalent to []byte
            - Indexing into a string produces the raw byte values at each index.


    17b. Runes
            - In Go, the concept of a character is called a rune - it’s an integer
              that represents a Unicode code point.
            - https://go.dev/blog/strings


    18. Structs
    19. Methods
            - Go supports methods defined on struct types.
            - Methods on struct can have "receiver type", which could be a pointer or a value.

    20. Interfaces
            - 'Interfaces' are named collections of method signatures.
            - To implement an interface, implement all its methods.
            - If a variable has interface type, we can call methods on its interface.

    21. Struct Embedding
            - Go allows embedding of structs and interfaces.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@     Go Templates     @@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
0. Intro to Go Templates
    - Mainly used to output HTML.

Hello World Example
-------------------
hello.html
---
{{ template "header" }}
Hello World! My name is {{ .name }}.
{{ template "footer" }}

common.html
---
{{ define "header" }}
{{ end }}

{{ define "footer" }}
{{ end }}

1. Template Composition
2. Syntax and Variables
3. Functions, methods and pipes

- Templates are mostly used to output HTML, but there are other use cases (like Terraform templates)

- In other templating engines (Django, Jinja2, Laravel blade etc), template references are static
    e.g. {% include "partials/header.html" %}
        - references a specific template relative to the template dir


- Go's template references are dynamic and you must *compose* the templates yourself
    e.g. {{ template "header" }}
        - What is "header"? It depends on what templates you composed together.



- Big Idea:
    - In Go, a template is essentially a map[string]*Template
    - When you compose templates together, you are populating this
      map[string]*Template data structure


Syntax and Variables:

{{ define ... }}
{{ template ... }}
{{ block .. }} {{ end }}
{{ if <var> }} {{ else if <var> }} {{ else }} {{ end }}
{{ with <var> }} {{ end }}
{{ range <var> }} {{ else }} {{ end }}

- Everything else (and, or, not, len, index etc) is a function.
- Every template has access to exactly one variable, denoted by dot '.'
    - This is whatever variable you passed into Execute()/ExecuteTemplate()
