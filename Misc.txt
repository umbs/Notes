Rob Pike's 5 Rules of Programming

Rule 1. You can't tell where a program is going to spend its time. Bottlenecks
        occur in surprising places, so don't try to second guess and put in a
        speed hack until you've proven that's where the bottleneck is.

Rule 2. Measure. Don't tune for speed until you've measured, and even then
        don't unless one part of the code overwhelms the rest.

Rule 3. Fancy algorithms are slow when n is small, and n is usually small.
        Fancy algorithms have big constants. Until you know that n is
        frequently going to be big, don't get fancy. (Even if n does get big,
        use Rule 2 first.)

Rule 4. Fancy algorithms are buggier than simple ones, and they're much harder
        to implement. Use simple algorithms as well as simple data structures.

Rule 5. Data dominates. If you've chosen the right data structures and
        organized things well, the algorithms will almost always be
        self-evident. Data structures, not algorithms, are central to
        programming.

Pike's rules 1 and 2 restate Tony Hoare's famous maxim "Premature optimization
is the root of all evil." Ken Thompson rephrased Pike's rules 3 and 4 as "When
in doubt, use brute force.". Rules 3 and 4 are instances of the design
philosophy KISS. Rule 5 was previously stated by Fred Brooks in The Mythical
Man-Month. Rule 5 is often shortened to "write stupid code that uses smart
objects".

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@     TOR    @@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
Tor:
- Passing traffic by bouncing them across various Tor nodes across the globe.
  Minimum, Tor traffic passes through 3 nodes: Entry/Gaurd, Relay & Exit.

- Traffic is encrypted in layers (like Onion) before it is sent out from source.
    # of layers of encryption = # of Tor nodes traffic is passing.

- As traffic passes through each node, that node knows how to decrypt it's layer
  and forward to next Tor node.


@@@@@@@@    MUNICIPAL SOLID WASTE MANAGEMENT IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES @@@@@@@@

Facts:
- Humans generate 7-10 billion tons of waste per year worldwide.
- Waste from 2 billion people is not collected from their homes and
  neighborhoods.
- By end of century, 83% of world population will be in Asia and Africa.
- There are 3 billion people who lack access to controlled disposal facilities.
- By 2030 there will be 40 megacities (cities with 10 million or more
  population). Of that 32 will be in Asia and Africa.


Municipal Waste Generation and Characterization:
- Estimating Lower Calorific Value (LCV)
    LCV = 40(a+b+c+d) + 90e - 46W
    LCV in kcal/kg
    a = Paper
    b = Textiles
    c = Wood and leaves
    d = Food waste
    e = Plastic and rubber
    W = Water
    all of above in % of wet weight.

- Incineration without adding fuel requies LCV > 1000 kcal/kg
- Incineration with energy recovery requires LCV > 1500-1650 kcal/kg

@@@@@@@@@@@@@   Open/R  @@@@@@@@@@@@@@

- Build a routing _platform_ and not a routing _protocol_
- Applications are built on top of this platform in C++. Routing is one
  application.
- Each node in this network as following 4 components:
    * Decision
    * FIB
    * KV-Store
    * Link Monitor
- Zero MQ for message passing between nodes.
- Thrift: Message encoding. Populat open source library.

- Key-Value Store:
    - Key = Strings, Value = Thrift objects

Optimization in KV Store:
- Group nodes in to clusters
- STP within clusters
- Between clusters, similar to BGP's path tracing mechanism is used.

Scaling in KV Store:
-

Neighbor Discovery:
- Runs as a separate process.
- Works on link-level

@@@@@@@@@@@@@   Networks Illustrated: Principles w/o Calculus @@@@@@@@@@@@@@

Lesson 1:
---
- 8 principles in this course:
- Sharing (network medium) is hard
- Consensus is hard
    * Referral system.
    * Auction system with systems bidding.
    * Voting system.
- Crowds are wise
    * Amazon trying to solve Rating problem.
    * Netflix trying to solve Recommendation problem.

- Crowds are NOT wise:
    * Information cascade can happen and crowds may not think for themselves.

- Network is Expensive:
- Network of Networks:
    * internet is combination of many networks within networks.

- Layers on Layers:
- Bigger & Bigger:


Lesson 2:
---
- Mobile penetration rate:
    # of mobile subscriptions/total population

- Multiple Access
    * Morse devised Morse Code to use Telegraph Cable to transmit ./- notation.
    * Bell devised multiple transmitters and recievers on same Telegraph Cable.

- Frequency Division Multiple Access (FDMA)
    * N MHz = N cycles per second.

- 0G
    MTS (1946) - Mobile Telephone System
        * FDMA system
        * An operator was required
    IMTS (1964) - Improved MTS
        * No operator required
    DynaTAC (1973)
        * From Qualcomm

- Attenuation
    WiFi is in unlicensed frequency
    Cellular is in licensed frequency
    Attenuation is decaying of signal over distance

- Cell & 1G
    + Due to attenuation, we divided regions in to cells of hexagon shape.
    + Cell towers are at the center of hexagons and base stations at
      intersection of edges of hexagons. With this design, a base station can
      serve 3 cells.
    + Frequency ranges in one cell doesn't match with next cell to avoid
      interference, but they can match with non-adjacent cells. This is done for
      spectral efficiency.

- Frequency Reuse Factor
    + Number of frequency bands used.

- 1G
    + Cells were used first time in 1G.
    + AMPS (1986) - Advanced Mobile Phone System. Operated in 800 MHz band
      system.
    + Cellular technology transformed from 0G to 1G.
    + First operated in Chicago with 90 people and 10 cells. Demonstrated
      feasibility.

- 2G
    + Migration from Analog to Digital is the most significant change from 1G to
      2G
    + Digital screens started appearing.
    + Texting was a feature.
    + 2000 was the year when 2G came.

- TDMA (Time Division)
    + TDMA uses Frequency Division with Time Division.
    + Why didn't we do this before? Analog signalling didn't allow this.
    + Sometimes called F/TDMA.

- GSM (Global System for Mobile Communication) 1982
    + First system to employ TDMA
    + 3x more than Analog capacity.
    + GSM was quickly adopted by Europe.

- CDMA (Code Division Multiple Access) 1988
    + CTIA (Cellular Technology Industries Assoc) wanted 10x improvement.
    + Qualcomm had a different idea. They added a different dimension to time
      and frequency. A code is added with each communication.

- Codes?
    + Along with digital data signal, a "spreading code" is used to transmit
      data. data signal x spreading code is transmitted.
    + Receiver uses spreading code to decode data signal.
    + Designing spreading code is very tough.
    + It needs to have a property called "Orthogonal" that two spreading codes
      should cancel out.

- Qualcomm's CDMA improvements
    + Supposedly 40x improvement (theoretically). But in reality, much less.
    + CTIA voted Qualcomm's CDMA as a 2G standard in US.

- Near-Far Problem
    + Channel quality depends on distance from base station and obstacles in
      between.
    + How much power is needed to transmit data? It's measure in Watts (W). In
      fact, phones need power in milli Watts (mW) to transmit data.
    + Phones that are farther from BS transmit data at, say, 20 mW and by the
      time it reaches BS, it's say 2 mW. While those near to BS may be received
      at 10 mW. It is important to make these signals reach BS at constant
      power. There's easy algo for this.
    + BS tells phones at what power to transmit so it receives at constant
      power.
    + Transmit Power Control (TCP) Algorithm to solve NF Problem.

- Signal Quality
    + Power is not the problem. Quality is.
    + Increasing power by a phone causes interference.
    + Signal to Interference Ratio (SIR).

- DPC (Distributed Power Control)
    + Cells transmit data to BS. BS sends SIR to phones. Phones adjust power.
    + This process iterates and finally converges on a power.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@   C++ for C Programmers    @@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

- static_cast <new_type> (expression), dynamic_cast <new_type> (expression)
  const_cast <new_type> (exp), reinterpret_cast <new_type> (exp)

C++ is better than C (really?)
---
    + More type safe
    + More libraries
    + Less reliance on preprocessor
    + OO vs imperative

C++ Templates
---
    template <class T>
    inline void swap (T& d, T& s)
    {   T temp = s;
        s = d;
        d = temp;
    }

C++ Generics: Sum an array
---

template <class T>  //T is a generic type
T sum (const T data[], int size, T s=0)
{
    for (int i=0; i<size; i++)
        s += data[i]; // += must work for T

    return s;
}

- Defaults for function parameter in C++ must be at the end of the param list.
- When multiple default params exists, in a function call, values are assigned
  left to right.
        void func(int x=10, int y=20, int z=30);
        func(1, 2, 3);  // x=1, y=2, z=3
        func(1, 2);     // x=1, y=2, z=30
        func(1);        // x=1, y=20, z=30
        func();         // x=10, y=20, z=30


Multiple Template Arguments
---
- Be careful, as it can get very dangerous.

template <class T1, class T2>
void copy (const T1 src[], T2 dst[], int size)
{
    for (int i=0; i<size; i++) {
        dst[i] = static_cast<T2> (src[i]);
    }
}

- static_cast<> This is safe casting.

C++ casts
---
- 4 types of casting in C++
    + static_cast <type>    // considered safe
    + dynamic_cast <type>   // used with classes
    + reinterpret_cast <type>   // highly unsafe, similar to C
    + const_cast <type>     // cast away const-ness

    reinterpret_cast and const_cast are usually discouraged by instructor.

Representation of Graph
---
- Edge list representation
- Connectivity matrix (also distances).


List representation:
---
- Representation of directed graph with n verticies using an array of n lists of
  vertices.
- List i contains vertex of j if there is an edge from vertex i to vertex j.
- A weighted graph may be represented with a list of vertex/weight pairs.
- An undirected graph may be represented by having vertex j in the list for
  vertex i and vertex i in the list for vertex j.

Matrix Representation:
---
- Well known.

- Both these don't capture weight.


Dijkstra Shortest Path
---
TODO: Watch Prof. Bob Sedgwick's video.


Enum
---
typedef enum color {
    RED,
    WHITE,
    GREEN,
} color;

- enum is of type int.
- Unary operators can be overloaded. Their precedence cannot be overriden.


Operator Overloading
---

- Example of overloading ++ operator

typedef enum days {
    SUN,
    MON,
    TUE,
    WED,
    THU,
    FRI,
    SAT
} days;

inline days operator++ (days d)
{
    return static_cast <days> ((static_cast<int>(d)+1)%7);
}

- Example of overloading << operator

ostream& operator<< (ostream& out, const days& d)
{
    switch (d) {
        case SUN: out << "SUN"; break;
        case MON: out << "MON"; break;
        ...
    }

    return out;
}

- Combine above two examples

int main()
{
    days d = MON, e;
    e = ++d;    // this is calling operator++ (days) function
    cout << d << '\t' << e << endl; // calling operator<< (out, days)
}


C++ Classes
---
- Using example of a point in 2D graphs

class Point {
    public:
        double getx () {return x;}
        void setx (double v) {x=v;}

    private:
        double x,y;

}

- public, private (default), protected are access levels.

point operator+ (point &p1, point& p2)
{
    point sum = {p1.x+p2.x, p1.y+p2.y};
    return sum;
}

ostream& operator<< (ostream& out, const point &p)
{
    out << "(" << p.x << ", " << p.y << ")";
    return out;
}

- constructors
    + default constructor has no args.
    + Same name as class name.

- 'this' keyword is self referential pointer.
- destructor

- Constructor Example:

class point {
public:
    point (double x=0.0, double y=0.0):x(x), y(y) {} // constructor
    ...
private:
    double x,y;
}

    - Note the initializer list x(x), y(y). This is equivalent to
        this->x = x, this->y = y;
    - Can be done only in constructors.

Memory Management
---
- new --> equivalent to malloc()
- delete --> equivalent to free()
- They both are allocated from heap. Unlike Java, memory from heap are not
  garbage collected automatically.

Ex:
    char *s = new char[sz];
    int *p = new int(9); // single int, initialized to 9
    delete []s; // delete an array
    delete p;   // delete single element

~ destructor
---
- Destructor always has empty arg list.
- Can't be overloaded.

Randomly Generated Graph
---
    bool** graph;
    srand(time(0)); // seed
    graph = new bool*[size];
    for (int i=0; i<size; i++)
        graph[i] = new bool[size];

//2D array representing a graph

Density = Probability an edge exists, between 0 and 1

- Suppose Density=0.19

    for (int i=0; i<size; i++)
        for (int j=0; j<size; j++) {
            if (i==j) graph[i][j] = false;
            else graph[i][j] = graph[j][i] = (prob()<density);
        }

is_connected algorithm
---
    bool is_connected (bool* graph[], int size)
    {
        int old_size=0, c_size=0;
        bool* close = new bool[size];
        bool* open = new bool[size];
        for (int i=0; i<size; i++)
            open[i] = close[i] = false;
        open[0] = true;
        ...
    }

- Each iteration, add one node to closed set.

- Copy Constructors, Deep Copy vs Shallow Copy (or Referential Copy).

OVSDB Overview and Troubleshooting
---
- Pub/Sub model
- Daemons connect to OVSDB server on unix socket and register for set of
  tables/columns they are interested.
- Daemons get notifications on change to these tables/columns.
- Notifications have old and new values.
- Communication happens over JSON-rpc and follows OVSDB RFC.

- vswitch.extschema - contains info on all tables/columns. OVSDB server looks
  for this on start.
- vswitch.xml - explanation of each table/column.

Commands
--
$ ps -ef | grep ovsdb-server


@@@@@@@@@@     C++ @@@@@@@@@@@
Readup More On:
- References (vs Pointers)
- try/catch (Exception Handling)

Notes:
- Access global variables in local scope using ::

    using namespace std;
    #include <iostream>

    double a = 128;

    int main ()
    {
       double a = 256;

       cout << "Local a:  " << a   << endl;
       cout << "Global a: " << ::a << endl;

       return 0;
    }

- Use 'template' to accept any datatype in to a function

    template <class T, class U>
    T minimum (T a, U b)
    {
       T r;

       r = a;
       if ((T) b < a) r = (T) b;	// typecasting b to T

       return r;
    }

- new, delete, new[], delete[]; allocate and free memory.
	char *c = new char [15];
	delete[] c;

@@@@@@@@@@@    STANDARD   TEMPLATE   LIBRARY    @@@@@@@@@@@@@

- STL containts five kinds of components:
    * Containers: vectors, bit vectors, lists, deques, sets, multisets, maps,
                  multimaps, queues, stacks and priority queues.
    * Iterators
    * Algorithms
    * Function Objects
    * Allocators


Vectors
=======
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

vector<T> N;    // Empty vector
vector<T> N[10]; // An array of 10 vectors. "May be" not what we want.
vector<T> N(10); // Vector of size 10.
int count = v.size();   // size of vector. Don't use this to determine if vector
                        // is empty.
bool is_empty = v.empty();

vector<int> v;
v.push_back(100);   // adds 100 at end of vector. Don't worry about memory
                    // allocation. It's NOT done one at a time.

v.resize();     // resize

NOTE: Is you push_back() after resize(), new elements are added AFTER newly
created memory and NOT INTO it.

v.clear();  // vector now has zero elems.


Vector Initialization
-------
vector<int> v1;     // Default values are zeros
...
vector<int> v2 = v1;
vector<int> v3(v1);


vector<int> nums (20, 5);   // Default values are 5.
vector<string> names (20, "Unknowns");  // Defaults to "Unknowns"


Multidimensional Vectors
--------
vector< vector<int> > Matrix;
vector< vector<int> > Matrix(N, vector<int>(M));    // of size NxM, with zero
                                                    // default values
vector< vector<int> > Matrix(N, vector<int>(M, -1));    // of size NxM, -1

Pairs
=====

A simple form:

template<typename T1, typename T2> struct pair {
     T1 first;
     T2 second;
};

pair<int, int> P;   // pair of ints
pair<string, pair<int, int> > P;    // pair of string and two ints.

 pair<string, pair<int,int> > P;
 string s = P.first; // extract string
 int x = P.second.first; // extract first int

Week 1: Boolean Logic
-----
Commutative Law:
---
x AND y = y AND x
x OR y = y OR x

Associative Law:
---
x AND (y AND z) = (x AND y) AND z
x OR (y OR z) = (x OR y) OR z

Distributive Law:
---
x AND (y OR z) = (x AND y) OR (x AND z)
x OR (y AND z) = (x OR y) AND (x OR z)


De Morgan Law:
---
NOT (x OR y) = NOT (x) AND NOT (y)
NOT (x AND y) = NOT (x) OR NOT (y)

Idempotent Law:
---
w AND w = w
w OR w = w



Truth Table to Boolean Expression: How to?
---
- For every row resulting in 1, write a boolean expression for that row alone
  (ignore other rows). OR all these expressions.

Theorem 1:
Any boolean function can be represented using an expression containing AND, OR
and NOT.

Theorem 2:
A boolean function can be represented using AND and NOT gates only.

Theorem 3:
A boolean function can be represented using NAND gate alone.

x NAND y = NOT (x AND y)

- How can an AND be done using NAND?
    x AND y = NOT (x NAND y)

- How can a NOT be done using NAND?
    NOT (x) = x NAND x

Logic Gates
---

Truth Table of NAND gate:
    x   y   out
    0   0   1
    0   1   1
    1   0   1
    1   1   0

Functional Spec: if (x==1 and y==1) then out = 0
                 else out = 1


Other elementary gates: AND, OR and NOT


Composite Gates:
---
- Some of logic gates to form a more complex gate.


HDL:
---
- HDL is a functional/declarative language.
- Order of HDL statements is insignificant.
- Interface of logic gates:
    Not (a=, out=), And (a=, b=, out=), Or (a=, b=, out=)

- Common HDLs: VHDL, Verilog and many more.
-


Multiplexor:
-----
Three Inputs: a, b, sel
One Output: out

if (sel ==0) out = a
else out = b


Demultiplexor: Inverse of Multiplexor
---
Input: in, sel
Output: a, b

if (sel==0) {a,b} = {in,0}
else {a,b} = {0,in}



Project 1: 3 types of logic gates will be built.

    Elementary Logic Gates: Not, And, Or, Xor, Mux, DMux
    16-bit variants: Not16, And16, Or16, Mux16
    Multi-way variants: Or8Way, Mux4Way16, Mux8Way16, DMux4Way, DMux8Way

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@  HTML5, CSS & Javascript for Web Developers   @@@@@@@@@@@@

// starting browser-sync
$ browser-sync start --server --directory --files "*"

- HTML elements and tags are same. Used interchangeably.
- Tags have attributes (name-value pairs)
    <p id="myId"> ... </p>
- Attributes have their own requirements. For ex. id attribute must be unique
  across HTML document.

HTML Content Models: (1) Block-Level Elements (2) Inline Elements
- HTML5 has 7 types of elements

- Semantic HTML5 tags
    - May help SEO ranking. But varying opinions

- HTML5 Lists: Ordered and Unordered Lists

Character Entity Reference:
---
<   use '&lt;' instead
>   use '&gt;' instead
&   use '&amp;' instead
- There are many more (like copyright symbol etc)

Links
-----
- Internal links
    <a href="">
    // value in href is absolute or relative url
- In HTML5, <a> tag is both block and inline tag (flow and phrasing content).
  So, we can take a <a> tag and have <div> tag within it.

- <a href="#section1"> text </a>
  ...
  <section id="section1"> more text </section>

- <img src="" width="" height="" alt=""> &quot; text



Intro to CSS3
------
- Every browser comes with default style. CSS rules override it.

Anatomy of CSS Rule:
------
    p {
        color: blue;
    }

p = selector
CSS declaration --> color: blue;
color = Property
blue = Value

- Collection of CSS rules is a Style Sheet

Element, Class and ID Selectors
------
Element Selector - we select element name (like 'p' above)
Class Selector -
    .blue {     <!-- note the . in front -->
        color: blue;
    }

    - we create a 'blue' CSS class above

- How is Class Selector used?

    <p class='blue'> ... </p>
    <div class='blue'> ... </div>

ID Selector

    #name {     <!-- note the pound sign   -->
        color: blue;
    }

    <p id='name'> ... </p>
    <div id='name'> ... </div>


Grouping Selectors with commas

    div, .blue {
        color: blue;
    }

    <p class='blue'> ... </p>
    <p> ... </p>    <!-- no effect -->
    <div> ... </div>


- id attribute is least reusable as it can appear only once in the document

Combining Selectors
----

[1]
    p.big {
        font-size: 20pm;
    }

    <p class='big'> ... </p>    <!-- rule applied>
    <div class='big'> ... </div> <!-- rule NOT applied>

[2] Child Selector: Every 'p' that's direct child of 'article'

    article > p {   <!-- p is DIRECT child of article element -->
        color: blue;
    }

    <article>
        <p> ... </p>
    </article>

    <article>
        <div> <p> ... </p> </div>   <!-- unaffected -->
    </article>

[3] Descendant Selector: Every 'p' inside (at any level) of 'article'

    article p {
        color: blue;
    }

    <article>
        <div> <p> ... </p> </div>   <!-- rule applied -->
    </article>

[4]
- 1, 2, 3 are not limited to Element Selectors. It can be applied to class and
  id selectors

    <!-- every 'p' inside (at any level) an elem with class='colored'  -->
    .colored p {
        color: blue;
    }

    <!-- every elem with class='colored' that's DIRECT child of 'article' elem
    -->
    article > .colored {
        color: blue;
    }


[5] Adjacent Sibling Selector

    selector + selector

[6] General Sibling Selector

    selector ~ selector



Pseudo Class Selectors
------

    selector:pseudo-class {
        ...
    }

- Many pseudo-class selectors exists, but we cover following 5:
    :link
    :visited
    :hover
    :active
    :nth-child(...)

// TODO
- Pseudo-class selectors are very powerful. Watch Lesson 15 to get a feel.
  More reading is necessary for this.


Style Placement
------
- Have external style file and use it in all HTML files

Conflict Resolution
------
- 4 concepts come in to play to resolve conflict
    [1] Origin Precedence: Last declaration wins
    [2] Declarations Merge: Two declaration (non-conflicting) refering to same
        element gets merged. Both rules will be applied to the element.
    [3] Inheritance: DOM Tree
        A rule declared on a parent is inherited on all it's children
    [4] Specificity: Most specific selector combination wins
        - inline 'style' is highest score
        - !important ---> overrides all other CSS rules. Avoid using this.


                Specificity Score

    inline Style |  ID   |  Class, pseudo-class,   |    # of elements
                 |       |      attribute          |
     -----------------------------------------------------------------
                 |       |                         |

- Calculate the scores above and in conflict, highest score wins.

Styling
-------
- Lots of CSS properties that affect styling

    font-family: "Times New Roman", Times, serif, San Serif;
    color: #0000FF;     // RGB specification
    font-style: italic;
    font-weight: bold;
    font-size: 24px;    // its diff than points
    text-transform: lowercase;  // uppercase and others
    text-align: center;     // many more alignments

    // em = width of 'm'. It's relative font-size


//TODO: Listen to Lecture 18 Part 2, Styling Text. Instructor talks about
//cumulative doubling of font-size

The Box Model
-------------
- Around the content, 3 terms are used:
    * Padding
    * Border
    * Margin



                            (page  layout)
        +----------------------------------------------------+
        |                                                    |
        |    +==========================================+    | ---
        |    |                                          |    |  ^
        |    |    +-------------------------------+     |    |  |
        |    |    |                               |     |    |  |
        |    |    |                               |     |    |  |
        |    |    |                               |     |    |
        |    |    |           CONTENT             |     |    |height
        |    |    |                               |     |    |

        |    |    |                               |     |    |  |
        |    |    +-------------------------------+  ^  |    |  |
        |    |                                       |  |    |  v
        |    +=======================================|==+    | ---
        |  ^                    ^                    |       |

        margin               border               padding

             |<-----------     width   ----------------->|



- Margins DO NOT define width of the box
- CDT (Chrome Dev Tools) have all these details

Star Selector
------
- Universal selector. Select "every" elem and apply the rule

    * {
        property: value;
        // box-sizing: border-box;
    }

- Margins are cumulative. If 2 boxes are adjacent to each other, then margin
  between the boxes add up.
- It's not same for 2 boxes, top and bottom. Larger margin takes effect.

- 'box-sizing: border-box' - prefered CSS property.
- 'width' property applies to just the content. With 'box-sizing: border-box'
  it is applied to entire box.



- Content overflow
    - 'overflow' property: 'auto', 'hidden', 'visible', 'scroll'
    - Lookup to understand
    - Users do not prefer 'double scrolling': Having two scroll bars in a
      browser.


Background Properties
------
    background-color: blue;
    background-image: url("");
    background-repeat: no-repeat; // other options
    background-position: bottom right;  // other options

    background: url("") no-repeat right center; // all properties in one
    // background overrides all other individual properties since it's listed
    // last?

Position Elems by Floating
----
    float: right;
    clear: left;    // nothing should float to left of this elem
    // It's all getting confusing and messy. Must listen few more times to
    // this lecture.

- Floats can produce flexible layouts

2 Column Layout
----

Relative Positioning
    CSS offset properties: top, bottom, left, right
- Elem is positioned relative to its position in normal doc flow
- Elem is NOT taken out of normal doc flow. Even if moved, its original spot
  is preserved ex:

        position: relative;
        top: 50px;  // negative values allowed
        left: 50px;

- html elem is ALWAYS relative=positioned
- Absolute positioning depends on closest ancestor elem whose positioning is
  set to non-static value.

Media Queries
-----

    @media (max-width: 700px) {
        p {
            color: blue;
        }
    }

- If media feature (in this case "max-width: 700px") is true, the styles
  within curly braces apply.

- max-width and min-width are most common.
- media features can be combined with 'and' and comma operators.
    Ex:
    @media (min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 991px) {...}

- Comma is treated as OR
    Ex:
    @media (min-width: 768px), (max-width: 991px) {...}


Responsive Design
------
- Site designed to adapt its layout to viewing environment by using fluid,
  proportion-based grids, flexible images, and CSS3 media queries.

- 12 column grid responsive layout is most common layout
    * 12 is used because of it's factors: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12
    * To achieve fluid width, use %
- Viewport meta tag is used to turn off default mobile zooming.
    - Mobile phones zoom out the page and display it

    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
    - This tells browser to consider the width of device as real width of
      screen and set zoom level to 1 (100%)


Twitter Bootstrap
------
- Bootstrap is the most popular HTML, CSS and JS framework for developing
  responsive, mobile first projects on web

- Bootstrap grid system basics

    <div class="container">
        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-md-4"> Col 1</div>
            ...
        </div>
    </div>

    - Instead of 'div', can use other elems too
    - "container" or 'container-fluid" classes must be at top
    - All columns inside .row class
    - "row" class has negative width to align with rest of the regular
      content. Listen to Lecture 26 Part 1 for details

- col-SIZE-SPAN
    - SIZE: Screen width range identifier. Columns will collapse on each other
      (they'll stack) if width is less than SIZE
    - SPAN: How many columns the elem must span (1 to 12)

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@     NOTES    FROM     VARIOUS    TALKS     @@@@@@@@@@@@
The Effective Engineer [1]:
---
- Effort != Impact
    People like Jeff Dean work whose impact is 10x that of junior engineer

- Leverage = (Impact Produced)/(Time Invested)
    a.k.a ROI, Pereto Principle.

- Leverage: Guiding metric that effective engineers use to determine where to
  invest their time and effort.

- 5 High Leverage Activities for Engineers
    * Optimize for learning

1 Optimize for learning:
    - Learning compounds over time
        How? Read books, take classes, build side projects, attend
             talks/conferences

2 Invest in Iteration Speed: How fast can you get things done?
    - By investing in Tools. Rule: if you have to do twice, build tool for
      third time.
    - How to speed up debugging, build times.

3 Validate your ideas aggressively and iteratively:
    - Incrementally validating hypothesis is a high leverage approach. It can
      save months of wasted effort later.

4 Minimizing operational maintenance
    - Minimize time spent on maintaining existing software.
    - New features introduces new fire-fighting in future. Think carefully
      before introducing them.

    Types of complexities:
        Code Complexity
        System Complexity
        Product Complexity
        Organizational Complexity

Questions:
- What's high leverage activities you can work on?
- What's one thing that you did not like in your previous company's culture?

                            Extensibility


- Built concepts similar to LAG for NIC failover (called LBFO - Load Balancing
  Fail Over).

                                       PHY NICs


- Few other concepts: Port ACLs, Private VLANs, DHCP Guard

- Single Route - IO Virtualization (SR-IOV). Single physical NIC talks
  directly to VM instead of going through Hyper-V Switch.
- For SR-IOV to work, Physical NICs must be capable of this feature.

- Dynamic VM Queue
- Many more features, that I saw in Cisco/Juniper type switches. Wonder why
  they are all built in to Windows Server.

- State of SoA (Service Oriented Architecture) Networking in Industry
// Very detailed. Watch video

- What is Envoy?
    - It's a self contained proxy. It is NOT a library. Think like HAProxy.
      It's like a server (Nginx).
    - Other names used is 'sidecar'.
    - It's an L3/L4 filtering mechanism: It's byte proxy at it's core. Can be
      used for things other than HTTP
    - L7 filter architecture: Packets can be routed based on L7 info
    - Built with HTTP/2 first in mind. Uses gRPC
    - Does Service Discovery and Active/Passive health checking.
    - Advanced Load Balancing: Retry, circuit breaking, timeouts, rate
      limiting, outlier detection, shadowing etc
    - Best in class Observability: stats, logging, tracing
    - Edge proxy: routing and TLS (can be used as Nginx replacement)

Eventually Consistent Service Discovery
----
- Fully consistent service discovery problems are very popular (etcd,
  Zookeeper, consul).
- They are very hard to run at scale.
- Service discovery is an eventually consistent problem. Envoy is designed for
  it.

Advanced LB:
----
- Different Service Discovery types
- Zone aware LB
- Dynamic stats: Per zone, canary specific stats etc

Introduction to Virtual Memory

- Simple systems have single address space:
    * no protection
    * processes can stomp on each other's memory

- x86 Physical Memory Map

- Hard to develop for Physical Memory.

Advantages of VM
- Each process can have it's own view of memory
- Kernel memory is invisible to user space
- Process Memory can be moved and/or swapped to disk, all this is done by Kernel
  and user space program doesn't know.
- Physical RAM can be mapped to multiple processes at once (shared mem)
- Memory regions can have access permissions
    * read/write/exec

Memory Management Unit (MMU)
- Hardware responsible for implementing virtual memory
- Sits between CPU core and RAM. On most CPUs, it's part of the core.
- Separate from RAM controller
- Responsible for mapping user space programs to RAM and/or peripheral devices
- Handles Load/Store instructions
- Generates exceptions (Page Faults) on invalid access
    * Unmapped address or insufficient permission

Translation Lookaside Buffer (TLB)
- TLB is a list of mappings from virtual memory to physical address in H/W.
    * Also holds permission bits
- TLB is part of MMU.
- There are fixed # of entries in TLB, varies by CPU.

+-----------------------------------+

TLB Task
- Maps virtual address to physical address
- If not present or insufficient permission, generate a page fault

Page Faults
- It's a CPU exception, generated when software attempts to use invalid virtual
  address
    * virtual address is invalid or not mapped to physical addr
    * process has insufficient permissions
    * virtual address is valid, but swapped out

Kernel Virtual Memory
- In Linux, kernel uses virtual memory, just like user space processes. Not all
  OSes do this.
- Virtual address space is split
    * upper part is used by kernel
    * lower part is used by user space
- On 32-bit, split is at: 0xC0000000 (3GB)

    +-------------------+ 0xFFFFFFFF
    | Kernel Address    |
    +-------------------+ CONFIG_PAGE_OFFSET
    |                   | (default 0xC0000000)
    |                   |
    |                   |
    +-------------------+ 0x00000000

- Virtual address space is 4GB on 32-bit system, regardless of how much RAM we
  have.
- Kernel uses top 1GB and user space uses bottom 3GB

- 3 kinds of Virtual Addresses
    * Kernel:
        + Logical Address (kmalloc)
        + Virtual Address (vmalloc)
    * User space:
        + Virtual Address

- Kernel Logical Address:
    * Direct mapping to physical memory. If physical memory is small (say 8MB),
      then logical address maps entire 8MB directly. It helps in DMA and such.
    * In large memory systems, not all physical memory can be mapped in to
      kernel's address space. So, it's top 1GB of VM is mapped to BOTTOM half of
      physical RAM.
    * ~104MB at top of kernel VM is reserved for non-contiguous allocations
        + Used by vmalloc()
        + This is on 32-bit only. On 64-bit, there's lot more address space.

- Kernel Virtual Address:
    * Area above Kernel Logical Address space. Also called vmalloc area.
    * Non-contiguous memory mapping
    * Often used for large buffers, using vmalloc()
    * Used for memory-mapped I/O
        + Map peripheral devices in to kernel (PCIe, SoC IP blocks)
        + request_mem_region(), kmap()

User Space Virtual Addresses
----
- Only used portion of RAM are mapped, memory is non-contiguous, may be swapped
  out and can be moved.
- User space VA makes full use of MMU.
- Each process has it's own memory map:
    struct mm, pointers in task_struct
- At context switch time, the memory map is changed



Memory Management Unit (MMU)
---
- H/W component that maps VM to Physical RAM
- Page, basic unit of memory size:
    ARM - 4K
    ARM64 - 4K to 6K
    MIPS - widely configurable during kernel build time
    x86 - 4K

Terminology:
---
- Page: Unit of memory sized and aligned at page size.
- Page Frame (Frame): refers to page-sized and page-aligned physical memory
  block.
- Page is abstract, Frame is concrete
- pfn: Page Frame Number refers to physical page frames


MMU
---
- TLB holds VA + PA + Permissions

Page Faults
---
- Process accesses region of memory that's not mapped, MMU will generate a PF
- Fact of life in MMU, not a bad thing but want to minimize
- Page faults at context switch time
- Lazy allocation: Kernel will wait until pages are actually used to allocate it
  in Phys RAM

Shared Memory
---
- mmap() sys call allows user space process to request specific virtual address
  to map the shared mem region.
    * kernel may not be able to grant this request and mmap() can fail

Lazy Allocation
---
- User space program is never aware of page faults
- For processes that are time-sensitive, pages can be pre-faulted, or simply
  touched, at start of execution (something like setting to zero using memset)
    * If required, mlock() and mlockall() locks these pages in Physical memory
      and does not swap them out to disk.

Page Tables
---
- Entries in TLBs are limited resource.
- Far more mappings exists than in TLB at one time. Kernel must keep track of
  all of them.
- Kernel stores this in Page Tables
    * See struct_mm and vm_area_struct

User Space Memory Allocation
---
- There are *alloc() functions
- mmap() can be directly used to allocate and map pages
    MAP_ANONYMOUS - normal mem alloc
    MAP_SHARED - shared mem with other process
- brk()/sbrk() can be used to resize heap
- malloc/calloc uses
    brk() - for small mem alloc
    mmap() - for large mem alloc
- Stack expansion:
    * If process access mem beyond stack, page fault happens
    * Kernel allocates new page to extend the stack
    * See __do_page_fault() in arch/arm/mm/fault.c

Performance Analysis of QUIC protocol

QUIC - Quick UDP Internet Connections

Goals of QUIC:
- Security protection comparable to TLS
- Reduce connection latency

Setup Time: QUIC vs TLS
- TLS runs over TCP, so TLS key establishment follows TCP handshake
- QUIC combines these two in to single step, kind of reducing latency by half:
    * connection establishment and key agreement

Data Exchange: QUIC vs TLS
- TLS first establishes session key and then data exchange
- QUIC sends data along with session key establishment. So, 1 RTT saved

                    QUIC Protocol
    Client                              Server
cid = {0,1}^64
                c_i_hello:cid
                ------------------->    generate stk based on client IP



cid: Connection ID picked by cliend (64 bit)
stk: source-address token used to prevent spoofing
scfg: server config contains servers public Diffie-Hellman (DH) values

REST API's with Flask and Python

Python Concepts
====

Lists, Tuples & Sets
----
- Tuples are immutable
- Sets are unique and unordered

Ex:
    grades = [77, 80, 99, 100]  # Lists are ordered
    tups   = (77, 80, 99, 100)  # Typles are immutable
    sets   = {77, 80, 99, 100, 100} # Sets are unordered and unique. There'll
                                    # be only ONE 100
    print(len(grades))          # len() function calculates length of list
    print(sum(grades))          # sum() adds up elements of list

Set operations
----
    tups = (77, 80, 99)
    tups = tups + (100,)    # Note the , after 100. That's important
    tups2 = (15)            # NOT a tuple. It's just a number with braces
    tups2 = (15,)           # This is a tuple.
    tups2 = 15,             # This is a tuple.

    grades[0] = 50  # assignment. Allowed
    tups[0] = 50    # Not Allowed. Tuples are immutable
    sets[0] = 50    # Sets are unordered. We don't know which element is being
                    # replaced


- Add element to a set
    sets.add(60)
- Add element to a list
    grades.append(60)

- Union, Intersection, Difference of two sets
    set_one = {1,2,3,4,5}
    set_two = {1,3,5,7,9}
    print(set_one.union(set_two))           # output: 1,2,3,4,5,7,9
    print(set_one.intersection(set_two))    # output: 1,3,5
    print(set_one.difference())


Loops
----
- Iterables are strings, lists, set, tuples and more

my_string = "Hello"
for c in my_string:
    print(c)


Input()
----
- Accepts input from CLI

user_input = input("Please answer yes/no (y/n)?")   # Python 3.5 only
if user_input == 'n':
    # do something

If statements
----

List Comprehension
----
my_list = [x for x in range(5)]     # way of building a list
my_list = range(5)                  # also does the same thing
my_list = [x*3 for x in range(5)]   # [0, 3, 6, 9, 12]

print([n for n in range(10) if n%2==0])


Dictionary
----
- key:value pairs. Both keys and values can be anything. Very similar to hash
- Value can be another list, set, tuple or even dictionary

lottery_player = {
    'name' : 'Rolf',
    'numbers' : (13, 45, 66, 23, 22)    # value is a tuple
}

universities = {
    {
        'name' : 'Oxford',
        'location' : 'UK'
    },

    {
        'name' : 'MIT',
        'location' : 'US'
    }
}

- Accessing a key in Dictionary is using [] braces
    lottery_player['numbers']


@classmethod and @staticmethod
----
- A method that doesn't change for various objects of class can be declared
  with @classmethod. This makes it like a 'global' method for the class.

class Student:
    def __init__(self):
        self.name = "Greg"
        self.school = "MIT"

    @classmethod
    def get_school(cls):
        print("I study at MIT")

    @staticmethod
    def get_student():
        print("I'm a student")

- These methods are called using class name


OOP
---
Inheritance in Python classes
---
class Student:
    """
    all Student stuff
    """
    def __init__(self, name, school):
        self.name = name
        self.school = school


class WorkingStudent(Student):
    def __init__(self, name, school, salary):
        super().__init__(name, school)
        self.salary = salary

- Combining @classmethod with Inheritance can become complex


*args and **kwargs
---
- *args means variable function arguments, passed as List
- **kwargs means variable keyword arguments, passed as Set. Note that keyword
  arguments MUST follow positional arguments



Strings & Texts
----
- f-strings:

    ten = 10
    f"Hello world! There are {ten} people in world"

- Another formatting using .format() syntax

    hilarious = False
    joke_evaluation = "Isn't that joke so funny?! {}"
    print(joke_evaluation.format(hilarious))

- *args and **kwargs
    *args means variable function arguments
    **kwargs means variable key-value arguments

- Generators
    * Iterable
    * Iterator
    * Iteration

- Iterable: Any Python object that can give us an Iterator
- Python object should have __iter__ or __getitem__ method defined
  which returns an Iterator


- Iterator: Any Python object that has next method (Python2) or __next__
  method defined.

- Iteration: Process of iterating

Generators:
-----------
- Generators: They are Iterators that can iterate only once. Usually
  implemented as functions that 'yeild' and not 'return'

- Used when calculating large sets of data where intermediate results is not
  required to be saved for long.

Ex: Fibonacci numbers

# generator version
def fibon(n):
    a = b = 1
    for i in range(n):
        yield a
        a, b = b, a + b

This is used as follows:

for x in fibon(10000):
    print(x)

Map, Filter and Reduce
----
- Functional approach to programming

Map: Applies a function to all items in an input list
    map(function_to_apply, list_of_inputs)

Ex:

items = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
squared = []
for i in items:
    squared.append(i**2)

Above task can be simplified using Map as follows:

items = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
squared = list(map(lambda x: x**2, items))

It's possible to have list of functions as input on which to run Map()
function.

def multiply(x):
    return (x*x)
def add(x):
    return (x+x)

funcs = [multiply, add]
for i in range(5):
    value = list(map(lambda x: x(i), funcs))
    print(value)

# Output:
# [0, 0]
# [1, 2]
# [4, 4]
# [9, 6]
# [16, 8]



Filter: Create a list of elements for which a function returns True

number_list = range(-5, 5)
less_than_zero = list(filter(lambda x: x < 0, number_list))
print(less_than_zero)

# Output: [-5, -4, -3, -2, -1]



Reduce: Applies a rolling computation to sequential pair of elements of list.
For example, product of elements of a list

product = 1
list = [1, 2, 3, 4]
for num in list:
    product = product * num

# product = 24


With reduce:

from functools import reduce
product = reduce((lambda x, y: x * y), [1, 2, 3, 4])


Decorators: Functions that modify behavior of other functions.
- Very useful concept. Read up online.


HTTP Verbs
====

[verb] [path] [protocol]
Ex: GET / HTTP/1.1

Other Verbs: POST, DELETE, PUT, OPTIONS, HEAD and much more



REST Principles
====
What is REST API?
----
- It's a way of thinking on how a webserver (or service) responds to requests.
- REST responds with "resources" and not with "data"

- REST is Stateless

- How Dockers Work 1: chroot

Python example:

---
import os

uid = os.getuid()
gid = os.getgid()
os.chdir("/tmp")
os.chroot("/tmp")
os.setgroups([])
os.setgid(gid)
os.setuid(uid)
os.umask(077)
os.listdir("/")
---

- How Dockers Work 2: cgroups
- How Dockers Work 3: namespaces

- Namespaces is implemented using clone() syscall

- Dockers Design
    * A server process runs as root and controls all containers (this is
      Dockers Achiles heel)
    * This process is controlled by CLI tool 'docker'
    * Dockerfiles control images
    * The process manages containers, which are images in execution

- Registries
    * https://hub.docker.com
    * cloud.google.com/tools/container-registry <-- Google's own registry


Kubernetes Structure:
1) 'kubectl' is entry to Kubernetes deployment
2) Controller Manager controls cluster-level functions
3) Scheduler talks to nodes to allocate resources
4) nodes then host pods
5) kube-proxy runs on each node and controls the network on nodes
6) pods then have groups of docker containers in them
7) docker containers share the same logical volume

Definitions:
POD: A group of coordinating containers. It's the smallest unit the Scheduler
understands. The containers within the pod share some context and interact,
directly or indirectly, with each other.

NODES: Closely associated with machines no network

SERVICES:

KUBE-PROXY: Manages network access on a node. Controls access to services on
the node. It also does load balancing.

SCHEDULER: Which Nodes have available resources and runs Pods on them.

CONTROLLER MANAGER: controls all other cluster level functions

KUBECTL: Talks to REST endpoint (Scheduler/Controller Mgr) to make it do
things

===============  PROTOBUFS   ====================
- Protocol Buffers, replacements for JSON, XML and such
- Creation of Google in 2008 for internal server to server communication.
- Much faster than JSON/XML etc

- How do they work?
    * Binary serialization
    * Uses pre-determined schema for encoding/decoding
    * Compiled in to many languages

- Schema, how does it look?

    [required|optional]  [type] [var_name] = [seq no] [default=]

- Schema fields are indicated and aliased with a number and a tag
- Required, optional and repeated
- Schemas allow messages to be extensible

Advantages of Protobufs
---
- Lightweight: less space and faster transmission
- Easy to modify
- Extensible
