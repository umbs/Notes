    Poky = BitBake + Metadata 

Poky    = Build system used by Yocto Project.  
BitBake = Task executor and scheduler. 
Metadata = Task definitions 
    * Configuration (.config) = global defs of variables, such as compiler
                flags, location of image paths, machine archs etc.  
    * Classes (.bbclass) = encaps and inheritance of build logic, packaging etc.
                This does most heavy lifting in system. There are .bbclass for
                'how to build linux kernel', 'how to generate rpm package', 'how
                create root file system image' and so on. 
    * Recipes (.bb) = Logical units of software/images to build, ex. recipe for
                GNU tar command, GTK library, and so on. Recipes are also used
                define what packages get included in your final image.
