                   LDD NOTES
                   ==========

Questions: 
- When giving params to a module at command line, there should be no
  space. In an example where "Hello World" was passed, instructor
  mentioned something about shell interpreting double quotes and failing.
  Elaborate please. 

- After writing to a char driver using $echo "Hello World" > /dev/CDD and
  reading from it: $cat < /dev/CDD, is the module erasing contents of
  /dev/CDD? Why is it failing to read again? 

- 

===========
- Dowload full sourse from www.kernel.org 
- Make a softlink in /usr/src/ called linux, pointing to extracted full
  source.

        $cd /usr/src 
        $rm -f linux 
        $tar jvxf linux-3.12.9.tar.xz  // right untar command.
        $ln -sf linux-3.12.9 linux 

- Get a quick help on make prior to building the kernel, to understand
  various make options.
  
        $make help 2>1 | less

- Change EXTRAVERSION field to something (i added LDD). 
- We can do "make config" and explicitly provide Y/N options.

- Alternatively, copy a default boot config file from /boot/ directory in
  to current directory (as .config).  
- Then, run "make xconfig" to use GUI to configure and make. 
- Or, use 'make oldconfig', which uses .config file and if any options are
  changed, only those are prompted. In the end, two files are created: 
          .config  
          .config.old 

- Then type 'make' which uses new .config
- `make modules_install` installs the modules 
- `make install` 
- Once done, cd /grub and look at ...
- cd /boot and we should see 3 files in there: 
      vmlinuz-3.12.9-ldd (whatever we wrote in EXTENSION variable in
      Makefile) 
      initramfs-3.12.9-ldd.img 
      System.map-3.12.9-ldd 


Sequence of steps: 
    1. copy a config file from /boot/ to /usr/src/linux/ directory 
    2. make oldconfig - /* unclear, but I think its to setup proper config
                           options */
    3. make  
    4. make modules_install /* we skip `make install` because its included
                               `make` */ 
    5. make install     /* it installs boot loader */

- Module is dynamically loaded binary to extend kernel functionality. 
- `static` keyword is used for init and exit modules because to avoid
  namespace pollution. The symbols have to be unique across kernel. 
- printk writes to circular buffer in /proc/kmsgs. klogd reads from this
  and routes it to syslogd which looks at loglevel and routes it to
  /var/log/messages or remote.
