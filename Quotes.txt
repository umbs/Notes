================================================
BY AGE 40  YOU SHOULD BE SMART ENOUGH TO REALIZE THIS:
1. Someone makes 10x more than you do in a 9-5 job because they have more "leverage" with their work.
2. Distraction is the greatest killer of success. It stunts and destroys your brain.
3. You shouldn't take advice from people who are not where you want to be in life.
4. No one is coming to save your problems. Your life's 100% your responsibility.
5. You don't need 100 self-help books, all you need is action and self discipline.
6. Unless you went to college to learn a specific skill (ie. doctor, engineer, lawyer), you can make more money in the next 90 days just learning sales.
7. No one cares about you. So stop being shy, go out and create your chances.
8. If you find someone smarter than you, work with them, don't compete.
9. Smoking has 0 benefit in your life. This habit will only slow your thinking and lower your focus.
10. Comfort is the worst addiction and cheap ticket to depression.
11. Don't tell people more than they need to know, respect your privacy.
12. Avoid alcohol at all cost. Nothing worse than losing your senses and acting a fool.
13. Keep your standards high and don't settle for something because it's available.
14. The family you create is more important than the family you come from.
15. Train yourself to take nothing personally to save yourself from 99.99% of mental problems.

Til the day she dies.. everything she does... cooking, cleaning your house, taking care of your parents, bringing up your children, earning, advising you, ensuring you can be relaxed, maintaining all family relations, everything that benefits you. sometimes at the cost of her own health, hobbies, and beauty.

So who is really doing whom a favor?

Dear men, appreciate the women in your lives always, because it is not easy to be a woman.
Being a woman is priceless
