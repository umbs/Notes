                     PRIME       FACTORIZATION         TECHNIQUES
                     ============================================

Trial Division [1]:
---
To see if a small integer is prime, divide all the primes less than (or
equal to) its square root. For example, to show 211 is prime, just divide
by 2, 3, 5, 7, 11 and 13. Since there is no divisor among those primes,
211 is a prime number.

Theorem: Let a and n be integers such that a < n < a^2. n is prime iff
gcd(n, a!) = 1 

Trial Division works efficiently on small numbers. For large primes, trial
division is used for pre-screening and then further primality tests are
applied.  



Sieve of Erathosthene [2]
---
To find all primes less than N, list out the numbers 2 to N. Starting at
2, strike out all multiples of prime numbers up to sqrt(N). What is left
are prime numbers.  

This method is very fast and large list of primes need not stored on
computer and instead can be calculated on the fly. Calculating these
numbers is faster than storing and retrieving primes, apparently. 

Space is an issue: O(n)
Running time is: O(n(log n)log logn) bit operations.  

For very large N, segmented sieve can be used. Theoretically, time and
space can be improved. 



Wheel Factorization [3]

Need to read up again to understand better.
