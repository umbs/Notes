Generative AI Learning Path
  - https://karpathy.ai/zero-to-hero.html
  - "Deep Learning" by Bengio
  - Karpathy's videos on GPT from scratch
  - 3b1b's videos going over the math and fundamentals should give you a nice grip over the concepts.
  - After that I feel you would be ready to delve into newer papers and be able
    to understand what's going on and stay "relevant" as you said.

  - I compiled some - see here https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36195527
    - https://llm-utils.org/AI+Learning+Curation
  - https://github.com/swyxio/ai-notes/blob/main/README.md#top-ai-reads

  - Updated version: https://www.bishopbook.com

  - I studied Physics in college, so I mostly knew the Math.
      Here's what I used to self-learn:
      1. Machine Learning for Absolute Beginners by Oliver Theobald
      2. Introduction to Statistical Learning
      3. Machine Learning by Andrew Ng on Coursera
      4. Deep Learning by Andrew Ng on Coursera
      5. fast.ai
      6. Sebastian Raschka's PyTorch book
      Good Math refreshers:
      1. Mathematics for Machine Learning Specialization by Imperial College London
      2. Linear Algebra and Calculus series by 3blue1brown on YT
      Later I delved deep into Computer Vision for profession, and Edge AI for personal projects.

AI Terminology


Machine Learning vs Data Science
================================
ML: "Field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicity programmed"
  - Arthur Samuel (1959)
  - This is a software.

Data Science: "Science of extracting knowledge and insights from data".
  - Usually a slide deck.


Deep Learning
=============

many inputs ---> Big math equation ---> Output

Big math equation ==> Artificial Neural Networks. This is no relation to how brain work (real Neural Networks).

AI Transformation Playbook
----
1. Execute pilot projects to gain momentum.
2. Build an in-house AI team.
3. Provide broad AI training.
4. Develop an AI strategy.
5. Develop internal and external communications.


- Imperfect rule of thumb to decide what Machine Learning can and cannot do?
  - Anything you can do with 1 second of thought, we can probably now or soon automate.
